, “The Future of Computing”

In the past few years, there’s been an important shift in the world of computing. For most of the history of computing, the focus has been on doing ever more powerful calculations. But now, computation is increasingly about dealing with ever more complex forms of data.

And this shift is only going to continue. In the future, computation will be about making ever more sophisticated use of data. It will be about understanding and using data in ways that are far beyond the capabilities of today’s computers.

This shift has already started to have a profound impact on the world. In many fields, from medicine to finance to manufacturing, the ability to make effective use of data is becoming increasingly important. And as data becomes more and more available, the potential for using it to improve our lives is immense.

The future of computing is about harnessing this potential. It’s about finding ways to make better use of data. It’s about making computation more powerful and more accessible. And it’s about using computation to help us solve the world’s most pressing problems.
