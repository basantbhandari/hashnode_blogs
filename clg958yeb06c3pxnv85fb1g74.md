on the effects of music on the human brain, Time


Mozart’s music has been shown to improve memory, relieve pain, and reduce stress. But what exactly is it about his music that has such an impact on the human brain?

It turns out that the answer may lie in the fact that Mozart’s music is structurally complex. A study published in the journal Nature found that when people listen to complex music, their brains become more efficient at processing information.

The study’s authors believe that the complex structure of Mozart’s music helps to stimulate the brain’s neural networks, which in turn leads to improved cognitive function.

So if you’re looking for a way to boost your brainpower, it might be worth giving Mozart a try.
