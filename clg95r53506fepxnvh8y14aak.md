Introduction

Lee Kuan Yew, research article, research papers

Lee Kuan Yew was the first Prime Minister of Singapore, serving from 1959 to 1990. He was also the co-founder of the People’s Action Party (PAP), and is recognized as the founding father of modern Singapore.

Under his leadership, Singapore became one of the most prosperous countries in Asia, with a highly developed free-market economy and a strong state apparatus. However, his time in office was not without controversy, and he has been criticized for his authoritarian style of government and his use of detention without trial.

Early Life

Lee Kuan Yew was born on September 16, 1923, in Singapore, then a British colony. He was the son of a wealthy Chinese family. His father, Lee Chin Koon, was a successful businessman, and his mother, Chua Jim Neo, was a schoolteacher.

Lee was educated at the prestigious Raffles Institution and later at the University of Cambridge, where he studied law. He returned to Singapore in 1946 and began working as a lawyer.

Political Career

Lee Kuan Yew’s political career began in 1955, when he co-founded the People’s Action Party (PAP) along with several other like-minded individuals. The PAP was committed to achieving independence for Singapore from British rule.

In 1959, the PAP won a landslide victory in the first general election held in Singapore. Lee Kuan Yew became the Prime Minister, and Singapore became a self-governing state within the British Commonwealth.

In 1963, Singapore merged with the Federation of Malaysia. However, the union was short-lived, and in 1965, Singapore became an independent republic.

As Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew oversaw the transformation of Singapore from a sleepy backwater colony to a thriving metropolis. He introduced a series of policies aimed at modernizing the country and attracting foreign investment.

Under his leadership, Singapore developed a highly efficient and corruption-free bureaucracy, and a world-class education system. The country also became a major financial center, and its economy grew rapidly.

However, Lee Kuan Yew’s time in office was not without controversy. He was accused of curtailing civil liberties and using detention without trial to stifle dissent. He also oversaw the introduction of the Internal Security Act, which allows for the detention of individuals without trial if they are deemed to be a threat to national security.

Lee Kuan Yew stepped down as Prime Minister in 1990, but remained active in politics. He served as Senior Minister from 1990 to 2004, and Minister Mentor from 2004 to 2011. He retired from politics in 2011, but remained a influential figure in Singaporean society.

Lee Kuan Yew passed away on March 23, 2015, at the age of 91.
