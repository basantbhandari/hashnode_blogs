, "The Art of Computer Programming", 1968

The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP) is a comprehensive monograph written by Donald Knuth that covers many kinds of programming algorithms and techniques.

 Knuth began the project, originally conceived as a single book with twelve chapters, in 1962. The first three volumes of what was then expected to be a seven-volume set were published in 1968, 1969, and 1973. The first volume of Volume 4 was published in 1981. The fifth volume, Combinatorial Algorithms, was completed in 1986, and the sixth volume, Graph Theory, came out in 2011. The seventh volume, which covers miscellaneous topics, is planned for release in 2020.

The books have been well received, with the first two volumes winning the ACM Turing Award in 1974. All of the volumes are still in print, and they are widely considered to be classics in the field of computer science.
