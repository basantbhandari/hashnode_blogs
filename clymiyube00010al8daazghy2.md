You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return `true`Â *if* `n` *new flowers can be planted in the* `flowerbed` *without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and* `false` *otherwise*.

**Example 1:**

```python
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```python
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
    
* `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
    
* There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
    
* `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`
    

Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        f = [0] + flowerbed + [0]

        for i in range(1, len(f)-1): # skip first and last
            if f[i-1] == 0 and f[i] == 0 and f[i+1] == 0:
                f[i] = 1
                n -= 1
        return n <= 0
```
