# Garbage collection in dotnet

Garbage collection is a memory management technique used by .NET (a software development framework created by Microsoft) to automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation for managed code running in the .NET runtime environment. The garbage collector identifies and frees the memory that is no longer being used by the application, which helps prevent memory leaks and other memory-related errors.

Here are some key aspects of garbage collection in .NET:

1. Automatic: Garbage collection in .NET is automatic and transparent to the developer. The garbage collector runs periodically in the background to reclaim memory that is no longer being used by the application.
    
2. Managed code only: Garbage collection only applies to managed code, which is code that runs within the .NET runtime environment. Unmanaged code (such as code written in C or C++) does not use garbage collection.
    
3. Mark and sweep algorithm: The garbage collector in .NET uses a mark-and-sweep algorithm to identify and reclaim memory that is no longer being used by the application. This involves marking objects that are still in use and sweeping the memory to reclaim objects that are no longer in use.
    
4. Finalization: .NET also provides a mechanism for objects to perform finalization (i.e., cleanup) before they are garbage collected. Objects can implement a finalizer method, which is called by the garbage collector before the object is reclaimed.
    

Developers can also use the System.GC class in .NET to interact with the garbage collector, such as requesting a garbage collection to occur immediately, determining the state of the garbage collector, and monitoring memory usage.
