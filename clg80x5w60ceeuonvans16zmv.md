There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best way to deploy a Go application will vary depending on the specific application and infrastructure. However, some common methods for deploying Go applications include using a containerization tool such as Docker, using a cloud-based platform such as Google App Engine, or using a traditional web server such as Apache or Nginx.
