Since taking office in 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping has embarked on an ambitious and wide-ranging campaign to consolidate power and tighten control over Chinese society. The campaign has included a crackdown on dissent and civil society, a massive propaganda and censorship effort, and a purge of officials suspected of corruption or disloyalty.

Xi’s consolidation of power has been compared to that of former Chinese leader Mao Zedong, and there are concerns that China is returning to a more authoritarian form of government. However, it is also possible that Xi is simply responding to the challenges of governing a country that is increasingly complex and diverse.

What is certain is that Xi’s policies have had a profound impact on China, and on the world.
