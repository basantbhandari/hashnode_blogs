Client-side frameworks like Angular were introduced to address the growing complexity of web applications and to provide a better user experience. In the early days of the web, most web applications were simple and static, and they were primarily built using server-side technologies like PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Java.

However, as web applications became more complex, with more dynamic content and interactive user interfaces, it became clear that server-side rendering alone was not enough to provide the performance and user experience that users expect. This is because server-side rendering requires a complete page refresh each time a user interacts with the application, which can result in slow load times and poor user experience.

Client-side frameworks like Angular were introduced to address these issues by allowing web applications to be built as single-page applications (SPAs) that load all necessary resources on the initial page load and then dynamically update the content in response to user interactions. This approach provides a more fluid and responsive user experience and can improve performance by reducing the number of round trips to the server.

Additionally, client-side frameworks provide a more structured approach to building web applications, with a clear separation of concerns between the presentation layer and the business logic. This makes it easier to build and maintain complex web applications and allows for greater flexibility and extensibility.
