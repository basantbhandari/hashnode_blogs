No, GraphQL is not a database technology. It is a query language and runtime for APIs that can be used to access data from any data source, including databases, microservices, and other APIs.

GraphQL is often used in conjunction with databases, but it is not a replacement for them. Instead, it provides a way to query and retrieve data from multiple data sources using a single API endpoint.

GraphQL can be used with a variety of databases, including SQL databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL, NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Cassandra, and graph databases like Neo4j and Amazon Neptune. However, the choice of database technology is independent of the use of GraphQL, and GraphQL can be used with any data source that exposes a GraphQL API.
