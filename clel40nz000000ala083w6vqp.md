# can we have try block without catch block?

Yes, it is possible to have a try block without a catch block in C#. The try block can be followed by either a finally block or both a finally block and a catch block.

The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught, and can be used to release any resources or perform any cleanup operations that need to be done, such as closing a file or releasing a database connection.

Here's an example of a try-finally statement without a catch block:

```csharp
csharpCopy codetry
{
    // code that may throw an exception
}
finally
{
    // code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught
    Console.WriteLine("Finally block executed.");
}
```

In this example, the try block contains code that may throw an exception, but there is no catch block to handle it. Instead, there is a finally block that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught. This block can be used to perform any necessary cleanup operations, such as closing a file or releasing a database connection.

It's important to note that if an exception is thrown in the try block and there is no catch block to handle it, the exception will be propagated up the call stack to the next method or the application's entry point, where it can be caught and handled by an appropriate catch block or the default unhandled exception handler.
