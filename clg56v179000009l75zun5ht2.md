In Angular, the `template` property of a component is used to define the template that will be rendered in the component's view. This template can include HTML, CSS, and Angular directives, but it should not include any JavaScript code or script tags.

If you try to use a script tag inside an Angular template, the script will not be executed because Angular sanitizes the template and removes any unsafe content, including script tags. This is done for security reasons, as allowing scripts to be executed in a template could lead to security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Instead of including JavaScript code in an Angular template, you should use Angular's built-in functionality and directives to handle dynamic behavior and data manipulation. If you need to run JavaScript code in response to user actions or other events, you can use event bindings to trigger methods defined in your component's TypeScript code.

In general, it's best to follow Angular's guidelines and best practices for defining templates and avoid including any unsafe content, including script tags, in your templates.
