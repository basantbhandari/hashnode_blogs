# concept of MVC scaffolding in Dotnet

MVC scaffolding is a feature in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC that generates code for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations based on a model class. The idea behind scaffolding is to provide a quick and easy way to create basic CRUD functionality for a model without having to write all the code manually.

Scaffolding in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC works by generating code based on a set of templates that define the basic structure and behavior of the generated code. The templates can be customized or replaced to meet specific needs.

To use scaffolding in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC, you can right-click on a controller in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer, select "Add", and then select "Controller with views, using Entity Framework". This will launch a wizard that guides you through the process of selecting the model class, data context, and template for generating the code.

Once the scaffolding is generated, you will have a basic set of views and controller actions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records from the database using the model class. You can then customize this code to meet specific requirements, such as adding custom validation or additional functionality.

Scaffolding in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC can save time and effort by generating basic CRUD functionality for a model class and can be customized to meet specific needs. However, it is important to review and test the generated code to ensure that it meets the requirements and performs as expected.
