Martin Luther King Jr. was an American Baptist minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. King is best known for his role in the advancement of civil rights using nonviolent civil disobedience based on his Christian beliefs.

Born in Atlanta, King is both the son and grandson of Baptist ministers. He attended Morehouse College, a historically black college, where he was deeply influenced by the views of its president, Benjamin Mays. After graduating from Morehouse, King enrolled in Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, where he won a prestigious fellowship. He subsequently received a Ph.D. in systematic theology from Boston University.

King became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1954. The following year, he helped organize the Montgomery Bus Boycott after Rosa Parks, an African American woman, was arrested for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white person. The boycott, which lasted for 382 days, ended with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that segregation on public buses was unconstitutional.

In 1957, King helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), an organization designed to provide leadership for the civil rights movement. The following year, he led the SCLC in a successful campaign to desegregate public facilities in Birmingham, Alabama. This campaign included a series of mass demonstrations and King’s now-famous “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” in which he argued that people have a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.

In August 1963, King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the “March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.” This event, which was attended by more than 250,000 people, is widely considered to be one of the largest and most influential civil rights demonstrations in American history.

In 1964, King became the first African American to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The following year, he helped lead voting rights demonstrations in Selma, Alabama, that resulted in the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

On April 4, 1968, King was assassinated by James Earl Ray in Memphis, Tennessee. King’s death caused widespread mourning and sparked a series of riots in American cities. In 1986, King’s birthday was designated a national holiday, and in 2004 he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
