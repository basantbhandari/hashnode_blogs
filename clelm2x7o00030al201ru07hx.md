# what is an area in Dotnet

In [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC, an area is a feature that enables developers to organize their applications into separate functional units. An area is essentially a self-contained MVC structure that can include its own controllers, views, models, and other related components.

By creating areas, developers can logically separate different features or sections of an application, making it easier to organize and maintain the code. For example, an e-commerce application might have separate areas for the shopping cart, user profiles, and product catalog, each with its own controllers, views, and models.

To create an area, you can use the "Add Area" command in Visual Studio or manually create a new folder with a specific naming convention. An area typically includes its own "Areas" folder with subfolders for each area, such as "Controllers", "Views", and "Models".

To access a specific area, you can specify the area name in the URL when calling an action method. For example, if you have an area named "Admin" with a controller named "Dashboard" and an action method named "Index", you can access it with the following URL:

```csharp
http://localhost/Admin/Dashboard/Index
```

Areas can also be used to apply different routing rules or authentication requirements to specific parts of an application. By defining separate route tables or authentication policies for each area, developers can customize the behavior of each area independently.

In the context of [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC, an area is a way to organize the related functionality of your application into separate modules. Each area can have its controllers, views, and models, and can be organized under a separate folder within the application.

Areas are useful in large applications where you have a lot of code to manage. By using areas, you can separate different parts of the application, and keep each part of the codebase focused on specific functionality. This makes it easier to maintain the code and can help improve the overall performance of the application.

To create an area in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC, you can right-click on the project in the solution explorer and select "Add Area" from the context menu. This will create a new area in your project with a default set of folders for controllers, views, and models. You can then customize the area by adding your code to these folders.

Once an area is created, you can access its functionality using a URL that includes the name of the area. For example, if you have an area named "admin" and a controller named "users", you can access it using the following URL:

[`http://yourapplication.com/admin/users`](http://yourapplication.com/admin/users)

In summary, areas in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC are a way to organize the related functionality of your application into separate modules and can help you keep your codebase more manageable and easier to maintain.

In summary, areas are a useful feature in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC that enable developers to organize their applications into separate functional units, making it easier to manage and maintain the code.
