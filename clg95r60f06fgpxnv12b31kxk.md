Research paper on Park Geun-hye, the President of South Korea.

Park Geun-hye is the first female president of South Korea and the daughter of the country's former dictator, Park Chung-hee. She was elected in 2012, after a close race with her opponent, Moon Jae-in. Park's presidency has been marked by several major crises, including the Sewol ferry disaster, the MERS outbreak, and the 2015â€“2016 South Korean protests. Park has also been accused of corruption, and in 2016, she was impeached by the National Assembly.
