Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. Authorization is the process of determining what a user is allowed to do.

In Go, authentication and authorization can be handled using the standard library's net/http package. The http.Request struct has a method called Authenticate that can be used to verify the identity of a user. The http.Request struct also has a method called Authorize that can be used to determine what a user is allowed to do.
