GraphQL is a versatile technology that can be used in a wide range of contexts where APIs are needed. Here are some of the main areas where GraphQL is useful:

1. Single-page applications (SPAs): GraphQL is well-suited for use in SPAs, where multiple views may need to access data from different parts of the application. By allowing clients to specify exactly the data they need, GraphQL can reduce the amount of data sent over the network and improve performance.
    
2. Mobile applications: Mobile applications often have limited bandwidth and resources, and GraphQL can help optimize data usage by allowing clients to request only the data they need. This can also help improve the performance and responsiveness of mobile applications.
    
3. Microservices architectures: GraphQL can be used as a gateway to a microservices architecture, where each service provides a single, well-defined set of functionality. By allowing clients to query only the data they need from each service, GraphQL can help reduce the complexity of integrating multiple services.
    
4. E-commerce platforms: E-commerce platforms often have complex data structures and require a lot of data to be transferred between client and server. GraphQL can help optimize this process by allowing clients to query only the data they need for a particular task, such as adding items to a cart or checking out.
    
5. APIs for external developers: GraphQL can be used to build APIs that are easy for external developers to use, as it provides a clear, easy-to-understand contract for the available data and functionality.
    

Overall, GraphQL is useful in any situation where a flexible, efficient, and easy-to-use API is needed.
