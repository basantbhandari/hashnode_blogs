Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that emphasizes the separation of concerns and the use of boundaries to create a modular, maintainable, and scalable system. It was developed by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, and is based on the SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

At its core, Clean Architecture divides a software system into layers or concentric circles, with each layer having a clear responsibility and boundary. The layers are as follows:

1. **Entity Layer:** This layer defines the business entities of the system. It contains the domain models and any business logic associated with them.
    
2. **Use Case Layer:** This layer contains the application-specific use cases or business rules. It interacts with the entity layer to manipulate the business entities.
    
3. **Interface Layer:** This layer provides the user interfaces and any communication interfaces for the system. It interacts with the use case layer to perform the desired actions.
    
4. **Infrastructure Layer:** This layer contains the implementation details for interacting with external systems, such as databases or APIs. It interacts with the other layers to provide the necessary data and services.
    

The key idea behind Clean Architecture is to ensure that each layer depends only on the layer beneath it and has no knowledge of the layers above it. This makes the system highly modular, allowing changes to be made to one layer without affecting the others. It also makes the system easier to test, as each layer can be tested independently.

Clean Architecture is often implemented using object-oriented programming languages like Java, but it can be applied to other paradigms as well. The ultimate goal of Clean Architecture is to create a system that is easy to understand, modify, and maintain over time.
