# difference between is and as in c#

both the "is" and "as" operators are used to checking the type of an object, but they are used in different ways:

1. "is" Operator: The "is" operator is used to check if an object is an instance of a particular type. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the object is compatible with the specified type.
    

Syntax:

```csharp
pythonCopy codeobject obj = ...;
if (obj is Type)
{
    // code to be executed
}
```

Example:

```csharp
csharpCopy codeobject obj = "hello";
if (obj is string)
{
    string str = (string)obj;
    Console.WriteLine(str.ToUpper());
}
```

In this example, the "is" operator checks if the "obj" object is a string. If it is, the code inside the if statement is executed, and the "obj" object is cast to a string and converted to uppercase.

1. "as" Operator: The "as" operator is used to perform a safe cast of an object to a specified type. If the object is not compatible with the specified type, the "as" operator returns null.
    

Syntax:

```csharp
pythonCopy codeobject obj = ...;
Type type = obj as Type;
if (type != null)
{
    // code to be executed
}
```

Example:

```csharp
pythonCopy codeobject obj = "hello";
string str = obj as string;
if (str != null)
{
    Console.WriteLine(str.ToUpper());
}
```

In this example, the "as" operator attempts to cast the "obj" object to a string. If the cast is successful, the "str" variable is assigned the cast value, and the code inside the if statement is executed.

Overall, the "is" operator is used to check the type of an object, while the "as" operator is used to cast an object to a specified type safely. The "as" operator is generally preferred over a direct cast using parentheses and the type name because it returns null instead of throwing an exception if the cast fails.
