# 20 best practices for node js developer

Here are 20 best practices for Node.js developers:

1. Use asynchronous programming techniques, such as callbacks, promises, and async/await, to handle I/O operations.
    
2. Use error-first callbacks to handle errors in Node.js.
    
3. Use a logging library, such as Winston, to log important events and errors in your application.
    
4. Use environment variables to store configuration values, such as database connection strings and API keys.
    
5. Use the Node Package Manager (npm) to manage dependencies and packages.
    
6. Use package-lock.json to ensure consistent package installations across different environments.
    
7. Use package.json scripts to define custom build and deployment scripts.
    
8. Use middleware to handle common tasks, such as authentication and error handling.
    
9. Use compression to reduce the size of HTTP responses.
    
10. Use caching to improve the performance of your application.
    
11. Use secure session management techniques, such as the use of secure cookies and the HTTPS protocol.
    
12. Use SSL/TLS to encrypt communication between your application and clients.
    
13. Use secure password hashing techniques, such as bcrypt, to store passwords securely.
    
14. Use the Node.js cluster module to take advantage of multi-core processors.
    
15. Use profiling and monitoring tools, such as New Relic and AppDynamics, to identify performance bottlenecks in your application.
    
16. Use unit testing and integration testing to ensure the quality of your code.
    
17. Use linting tools, such as ESLint and JSHint, to enforce coding standards and catch errors.
    
18. Use continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to automate the build, testing, and deployment of your application.
    
19. Use load testing tools, such as Apache JMeter and LoadRunner, to simulate high traffic and identify performance issues.
    
20. Keep learning and staying up-to-date with the latest Node.js developments and best practices.
