Transpiling is the process of converting code written in one programming language to another language that can be executed by the target platform or environment. In the context of Angular, transpiling refers to the process of converting TypeScript code to JavaScript code that can be executed by modern web browsers.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds additional features such as type checking, classes, and interfaces. While TypeScript is not directly compatible with web browsers, it can be transpiled into standard JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler.

In an Angular application, transpiling occurs as part of the build process. When you run the `ng build` command, Angular compiles your TypeScript code into JavaScript and creates a set of static files that can be served by a web server or deployed to a web host.

During the transpiling process, the TypeScript compiler analyzes your code, checks for syntax errors, and applies any language features that are not directly supported by JavaScript. The resulting JavaScript code is optimized for performance and compatibility with modern web browsers.

Transpiling in Angular is important because it allows developers to write code using modern features and syntax while still ensuring that the application will work correctly in a variety of web browsers. By converting TypeScript code to JavaScript code, transpiling makes it possible to take advantage of the latest language features and tools without sacrificing compatibility or performance.
