In 1976, 21-year-old Steve Jobs and his friend Steve Wozniak started Apple Computer in Jobs’s garage. The company was founded on the principle that technology should be accessible to everyone and easy to use. This principle has guided Apple for more than three decades and has made it one of the most successful companies in the world.

Today, Apple is a global leader in technology and design, with a product lineup that includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple is also the world’s largest information technology company by revenue, and its products are used by people in more than 175 countries.

Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955. He was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs and grew up in the Silicon Valley town of Mountain View. As a child, Jobs was fascinated by electronics and took apart his family’s television to see how it worked. He later recalled that he was “putty in the hands of a good teacher” and that his fourth-grade teacher, Mrs. Hill, was “one of the saints of my life.”

Jobs attended Cupertino Junior High School and Homestead High School, where he met Wozniak, a fellow student and budding computer engineer. The two became friends and would often work on electronics projects together. In 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. He dropped out after one semester, but he continued to take classes that interested him, including a calligraphy class that would later prove to be influential in the design of the Macintosh computer.

After leaving Reed, Jobs traveled to India in search of a spiritual guru. He later returned to the United States and took a job at Atari, a video game company. In 1976, he and Wozniak started Apple Computer in Jobs’s garage. The company’s first product was the Apple I, a personal computer kit that they sold to hobbyists.

The success of the Apple I led to the development of the Apple II, one of the first commercially successful personal computers. The Apple II was introduced in 1977 and became wildly popular, thanks in part to its use of color graphics and an easy-to-use interface. It was also one of the first personal computers to be used in schools.

In 1980, Apple went public and Jobs became a multimillionaire. The following year, the company introduced the Macintosh, the first personal computer to use a graphical user interface. The Macintosh was a commercial success, but it was not without its problems. Jobs was ousted from Apple in 1985 after a power struggle with the company’s board of directors.

He went on to found a new computer company, NeXT, which was later acquired by Apple. He also purchased The Graphics Group, which would eventually become Pixar Animation Studios. In 1996, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO and began the process of turning the company around. He helped develop the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which revolutionized the way people interact with technology.

Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011, after a long battle with cancer. He was 56 years old.
