# connected architecture vs disconnected architecture

Connected architecture and disconnected architecture are two different approaches to working with databases in software development.

Connected architecture refers to the approach where an application maintains an open connection to the database while executing database operations. In this approach, the application interacts directly with the database, and the data is typically processed in real-time. In connected architecture, data is fetched from the database as needed, and the application maintains a direct link to the database throughout the entire process.

Disconnected architecture, on the other hand, refers to the approach where an application fetches data from the database, closes the database connection, processes the data in memory, and then reconnects to the database to update or insert data back into the database. In disconnected architecture, data is fetched from the database into an in-memory cache, such as a dataset or a collection of objects, and is disconnected from the database until it is ready to be updated.

Both connected and disconnected architectures have their own advantages and disadvantages.

Connected architecture offers real-time data processing and immediate feedback, but it requires a consistent and reliable connection to the database, and it may put more strain on the database server, especially in high-traffic environments.

Disconnected architecture, on the other hand, reduces the load on the database server and allows for more efficient use of network resources. It is also more resilient to connection failures and network issues. However, it may require additional memory and processing resources to manage the in-memory cache, and it may be less responsive to real-time changes in the database.

In summary, connected architecture is suitable for applications that require real-time data processing, whereas disconnected architecture is suitable for applications that require more efficient use of network resources and greater resilience to network issues. The choice between connected and disconnected architecture largely depends on the specific requirements of the application and the constraints of the database environment.
