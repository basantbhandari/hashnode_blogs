MSBuild is the Microsoft Build Engine, a build platform used by .NET developers to build, test, and deploy software applications. It is a command-line tool that can be used to build projects and solutions created using .NET languages such as C# or [VB.NET](http://VB.NET).

MSBuild is a powerful and flexible tool that can be customized to suit the needs of individual developers or teams. It can be used to compile code, run unit tests, package code into deployable files, and deploy applications to servers or cloud environments.

To use MSBuild, developers create an XML-based project file (.csproj or .vbproj) that defines the contents and structure of the application, including references to other assemblies, build targets, and build settings. The project file is then passed to MSBuild, which uses the information in the file to build the application.

MSBuild is integrated with Visual Studio, which provides a graphical interface for building and debugging projects. However, it can also be used from the command line or integrated into automated build and deployment workflows using tools such as TeamCity or Jenkins.

Some common tasks that can be performed with MSBuild include:

* Compiling code
    
* Running unit tests
    
* Packaging code into deployable files such as NuGet packages or Docker containers
    
* Deploying applications to servers or cloud environments
    
* Generating documentation
    
* Cleaning up build artifacts
    

Overall, MSBuild is a powerful and flexible tool that is essential for .NET developers who need to build, test, and deploy software applications.
