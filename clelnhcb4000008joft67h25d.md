# different session state management options available in dotnet

Session state management is an important aspect of web development in .NET, as it allows you to store and retrieve user-specific data across multiple requests. There are several options available for managing session state in .NET, including:

1. In-Process Session State: In-Process session state is the default option in .NET, which stores session data in memory on the same server that is running the application. The in-process session state is fast and efficient, but it is limited by the amount of memory available on the server, and it does not support load balancing or failover.
    
2. State Server Session State: State Server session state stores session data in a separate process called the [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) State Service, which runs on a different server from the application server. This allows multiple application servers to share the same session data, providing load balancing and failover capabilities. However, the State Server session state requires network communication between the application servers and the State Service, which can impact performance.
    
3. SQL Server Session State: SQL Server session state stores session data in a SQL Server database, allowing multiple application servers to share the same session data, providing load balancing and failover capabilities. SQL Server session state is durable, as session data is stored in a database that can be backed up and restored. However, SQL Server session state requires additional configuration and setup, and it can be slower than In-Process or State Server session state.
    
4. Custom Session State Providers: Custom session state providers allow developers to implement their own session state management logic, tailored to the specific needs of their application. Custom session state providers can be used to store session data in other types of databases, such as Oracle or MySQL, or in other types of storage, such as Azure Redis Cache.
    

In summary, there are several options available for managing session state in .NET, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. By choosing the appropriate session state management option for your application, you can provide a seamless user experience, improve performance, and ensure scalability and reliability.
