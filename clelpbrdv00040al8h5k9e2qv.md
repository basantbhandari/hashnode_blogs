# What is entity framework?

Entity Framework (EF) is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework provided by Microsoft as a part of the .NET Framework. It enables developers to work with data in the form of objects and classes, rather than having to work directly with SQL queries and database tables.

EF provides several features, including:

1. Mapping between database tables and .NET classes
    
2. Tracking changes to objects and persisting those changes to the database
    
3. Querying data using LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
    
4. Managing relationships between objects and database tables
    
5. Generating database schema from .NET classes
    

EF supports several different database providers, including Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. It can be used with a variety of application types, including web applications, desktop applications, and services.

EF has several advantages, including increased productivity and code maintainability, as well as improved performance and scalability. However, it can also have a steep learning curve for developers who are not familiar with ORM concepts and patterns.

Overall, Entity Framework is a powerful and widely used ORM tool that provides a high level of abstraction and flexibility for .NET developers working with data.
