Authentication and authorization are two related but distinct concepts in the context of security and access control.

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It involves determining whether a user is who they claim to be, usually by requiring them to provide some form of credentials, such as a username and password. The goal of authentication is to ensure that only authorized users can access a system or resource.

Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of granting or denying access to a resource or system based on the identity of the user and their level of permission. Once a user has been authenticated, the system can use their identity to determine what actions they are authorized to perform and what resources they are authorized to access.

In simpler terms, authentication is the process of verifying someone's identity, while authorization is the process of determining what they are allowed to do.

To illustrate this further, consider an example of a web application that allows users to access certain resources, such as files or data. In this scenario:

* Authentication: The user is prompted to enter their username and password to log in to the application. The application verifies the credentials and confirms that the user is who they claim to be.
    
* Authorization: Once the user has been authenticated, the application determines what level of access they have based on their role or permissions. For example, a user with an "admin" role may have full access to all resources, while a user with a "viewer" role may only be able to view certain files or data.
    

Overall, authentication and authorization are both essential components of a comprehensive security strategy, and both must be implemented carefully to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive resources.
