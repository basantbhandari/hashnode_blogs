Triggers cannot be defined inside SQL functions or stored procedures in most SQL database systems.

A trigger is a database object that is executed automatically in response to a specific event, such as an insert, update, or delete operation on a table. A trigger can be used to enforce business rules, perform data validation, or log changes to a table.

On the other hand, SQL functions and stored procedures are database objects that are explicitly called by a user or application to perform a specific task or return a specific value.

While a trigger and a stored procedure may have similar functionalities, they are implemented and used differently. A trigger is automatically executed by the database when an event occurs, while a stored procedure is explicitly called by a user or application to perform a specific task.

In some database systems, triggers can call stored procedures or functions, but the reverse is not possible. In general, it is recommended to keep the functionalities of triggers, functions, and stored procedures separate to ensure the modularity and maintainability of the database system.
