# what is authentication and authorization in ASP.NET MVC?

Authentication and authorization are two important concepts in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC that are used to control access to resources in a web application.

Authentication is the process of identifying a user and ensuring that they are who they claim to be. In [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC, authentication is typically achieved by requiring users to enter a valid username and password, and verifying their credentials against a user store such as a database or an LDAP directory. Once a user has been authenticated, their identity can be used to determine what resources they are authorized to access.

Authorization is the process of determining whether a user has permission to access a particular resource or perform a particular action. In [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC, authorization is typically achieved by applying permissions or roles to users or groups and checking these permissions or roles before allowing access to a resource. Authorization can be applied at various levels, including the controller level, the action level, or the view level, depending on the needs of the application.

In [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC, authentication and authorization are typically implemented using the [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Identity system, which provides a flexible and extensible framework for managing user accounts, roles, and permissions. The [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Identity system includes built-in support for common authentication mechanisms such as username/password authentication, external authentication providers such as Google or Facebook, and two-factor authentication. It also provides a range of options for managing user roles and permissions, including role-based authorization, claim-based authorization, and policy-based authorization.

Overall, authentication and authorization are essential components of any web application that requires secure access to resources. In [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC, these concepts are implemented using a powerful and flexible system that can be customized to meet the needs of a wide range of applications.
