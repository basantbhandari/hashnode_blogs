## What is Wazuh?

Wazuh is an open-source security monitoring platform that combines Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), endpoint detection and response (EDR), and threat detection capabilities into a unified solution. Originally derived from OSSEC, Wazuh has evolved significantly, becoming a powerful tool for threat detection, integrity monitoring, compliance, and incident response. It is widely used by enterprises and security professionals to monitor infrastructure and detect security anomalies across on-premise, cloud, and hybrid environments.

Wazuh integrates seamlessly with other open-source technologies, particularly the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), to provide advanced data analysis and visualization capabilities.

## Key Features of Wazuh

### 1\. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**

Wazuh collects, processes, and analyzes logs from multiple sources, identifying security threats and anomalies in real time. It can aggregate data from:

* Operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS)
    
* Cloud services (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
    
* Applications (web servers, databases, etc.)
    
* Network devices (firewalls, routers, etc.)
    

### 2\. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**

Wazuh provides robust endpoint security by monitoring system activities, identifying potential intrusions, and detecting vulnerabilities. It can respond to incidents by triggering automated actions, such as blocking IP addresses or isolating compromised endpoints.

### 3\. **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**

File integrity monitoring is a crucial feature that detects unauthorized changes to critical files and directories. Wazuh can track file modifications, deletions, and permissions changes, ensuring compliance with security policies.

### 4\. **Vulnerability Detection**

Wazuh performs vulnerability scanning by comparing installed software versions against known vulnerabilities and security advisories. It integrates with third-party vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

### 5\. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**

Wazuh can identify known attack patterns and malicious activities by analyzing network traffic and log data. It supports custom rules and integrates with popular threat intelligence feeds to stay updated on emerging threats.

### 6\. **Compliance Monitoring**

Wazuh helps organizations comply with security standards and regulations such as:

* GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
    
* HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
    
* PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
    
* CIS Controls (Center for Internet Security Controls)
    

It generates detailed compliance reports and continuously audits system configurations for deviations from compliance baselines.

### 7\. **Log Analysis and Correlation**

Wazuh parses and normalizes log data from different sources, making it easy to correlate events and identify complex attack scenarios. It supports rules and decoders for various log formats and can detect anomalies through correlation logic.

### 8\. **Threat Intelligence Integration**

Wazuh integrates with threat intelligence services to enrich alerts and improve threat detection accuracy. Popular integrations include VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX, and AbuseIPDB.

### 9\. **Real-Time Alerts and Incident Response**

Wazuh offers real-time alerting capabilities, enabling security teams to respond promptly to potential threats. It supports integration with notification systems like email, Slack, and PagerDuty for automated incident response workflows.

## Architecture of Wazuh

Wazuh's architecture comprises the following components:

### 1\. **Wazuh Agent**

The Wazuh agent is installed on monitored endpoints and collects system logs, processes security events, and performs integrity checks. It sends data to the Wazuh server for analysis.

### 2\. **Wazuh Server**

The server analyzes data received from agents, applies detection rules, and generates alerts. It also manages agents, schedules tasks, and maintains security rules.

### 3\. **Wazuh Indexer**

The indexer, typically based on Elasticsearch, stores alert data and provides search and analytics capabilities.

### 4\. **Wazuh Dashboard**

The Wazuh dashboard, based on Kibana, provides a web-based interface for visualization, data exploration, and security management.
