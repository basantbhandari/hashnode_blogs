In Angular, when creating components, you can choose to define your component's template inline within the component's metadata or to define it in a separate external file. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on your specific use case.

To define the template inline, you use the `template` property in the component's metadata:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
  `
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  title = 'Example Component';
  message = 'This is an inline template';
}
```

To define the template in an external file, you use the `templateUrl` property in the component's metadata:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  templateUrl: './example.component.html'
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  title = 'Example Component';
  message = 'This is an external template';
}
```

The advantage of using an external template file is that it can be easily edited and maintained separately from the component's code, making it easier to manage and collaborate with other developers. It also allows for more complex templates to be defined, which can improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

On the other hand, defining the template inline can be useful for small or simple templates that do not require a separate file. It can also be more convenient for quickly prototyping and testing components, as the template code is easily visible within the component's code.

Ultimately, the choice between inline and external templates depends on your specific use case and development style.
