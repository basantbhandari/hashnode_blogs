# can you create an instance of an interface or abstract class

No, you cannot create an instance of an interface or an abstract class in .NET.

An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods and properties that a class must implement. It does not provide an implementation of those methods or properties. Similarly, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and requires its derived classes to provide an implementation of its abstract methods.

Since interfaces and abstract classes do not provide an implementation of their methods and properties, they cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, you must create a class that implements the interface or extends the abstract class and provides an implementation for its methods and properties.

Here's an example of creating a class that implements an interface in C#:

```csharp
csharpCopy codepublic interface IExampleInterface
{
    void DoSomething();
}

public class ExampleClass : IExampleInterface
{
    public void DoSomething()
    {
        // implementation of DoSomething method
    }
}

// creating an instance of ExampleClass
ExampleClass example = new ExampleClass();
```

In this example, we first define an interface called `IExampleInterface` includes a method called `DoSomething()`. We then create a class called `ExampleClass` that implements the `IExampleInterface` interface and provides an implementation for the `DoSomething()` method. Finally, we create an instance of `ExampleClass` using the `new` keyword.
