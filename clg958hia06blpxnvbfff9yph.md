The following is an excerpt from a research article by Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates.

In this paper, I will describe the major forces that have led to the current situation, including the debt cycle and the global reserve currency system. I will also discuss the key risks that we face in the years ahead, and how we can protect ourselves from them.

The Debt Cycle

The current situation is the result of a debt cycle that has been building for decades. It began with the baby boomers, who borrowed heavily to finance their education and consumption. This led to rising debt levels and higher interest rates.

As debt levels rose, the economy slowed and asset prices fell. This led to defaults and foreclosures, which further weakened the economy.

The cycle continued as the government responded to the economic weakness by printing money and borrowing more. This led to higher inflation and higher interest rates.

The cycle continued as investors fled to safe havens such as gold and other commodities. This led to higher prices for these assets and a further weakening of the economy.

The cycle continued as the government responded to the economic weakness by printing money and borrowing more. This led to higher inflation and higher interest rates.
