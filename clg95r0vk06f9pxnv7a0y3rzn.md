Indira Gandhi was the first female Prime Minister of India and a central figure in the Indian National Congress party. She was elected Prime Minister in 1966 and served until 1977, when she was ousted from power by a conservative coalition. She then regained power in 1980 and served until her assassination in 1984. Gandhi was a controversial figure, revered by her supporters and despised by her opponents. She was accused of authoritarianism and corruption, and her opponents accused her of fomenting religious and caste violence. Nonetheless, she remains an iconic figure in Indian politics.
