# 20 best practices for javascript programmers

Here are 20 best practices for JavaScript programming:

1. Use "use strict" in your code to enforce stricter parsing and error handling.
    
2. Declare variables with "let" or "const" keywords.
    
3. Use meaningful variable names to improve code readability.
    
4. Use a consistent coding style, such as following an established style guide.
    
5. Use functions and modular code to improve maintainability and scalability.
    
6. Use comments to explain the purpose and functionality of your code.
    
7. Test your code regularly to catch errors and ensure functionality.
    
8. Use a linter to check your code for errors and enforce coding standards.
    
9. Use modern language features, such as arrow functions and template literals, to make your code more concise and readable.
    
10. Use object and array destructuring to simplify variable assignments.
    
11. Use default function parameters to simplify conditional logic.
    
12. Use asynchronous programming techniques, such as Promises and async/await, to handle async operations.
    
13. Use function composition to combine multiple functions into a single function.
    
14. Avoid global variables to prevent naming conflicts and improve code modularity.
    
15. Use const instead of var to declare variables that do not need to be reassigned.
    
16. Use array methods, such as map, filter, and reduce, to manipulate arrays.
    
17. Use template engines, such as Handlebars and EJS, to generate HTML templates dynamically.
    
18. Use arrow functions to simplify callback functions.
    
19. Use class syntax to create reusable objects with shared properties and methods.
