There are many different ways to work with databases in Node.js. Some popular options include using the native Node.js modules for interacting with databases, such as the "fs" module for working with the file system, or the "net" module for working with network sockets. Other popular options include using third-party modules or libraries, such as the "mysql" module for working with MySQL databases, or the "mongodb" module for working with MongoDB databases.
