Volcker, who was Fed chairman from 1979 to 1987, has been a vocal critic of the Bush administration's economic policies. In a recent article in The New York Times, he wrote that the Bush tax cuts and deficit spending had created a fiscal crisis that was "not a Republican problem or a Democratic problem. It is an American problem."

Volcker, who also served as chairman of the National Commission on Public Service, has been a longtime advocate of public service. In his book, "The Courage to Act: A Memoir of a Crisis and Its Aftermath," Volcker wrote that he "grew up in a world where government service was a high calling."

Volcker has been critical of the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq war, and he has called for a withdrawal of troops. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Volcker said that the war had "undermined the morale and the capacity of the United States."
