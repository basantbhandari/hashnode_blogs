In .NET, documentation comments are written using XML tags that begin with three forward slashes (///) above the member declaration. Here is an example:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// This method adds two integers and returns the result.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="a">The first integer to add.</param>
/// <param name="b">The second integer to add.</param>
/// <returns>The sum of the two integers.</returns>
public int Add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}
```

Here are the steps to write a documentation comment in .NET:

1. Start the comment with three forward slashes (///) on the line above the member declaration.
    
2. Use XML tags to document the member. The most common tags are:
    
    * `<summary>`: Provides a brief description of the member.
        
    * `<param>`: Describes a parameter of the member.
        
    * `<returns>`: Describes the return value of the member.
        
    * `<remarks>`: Provides additional information about the member.
        
3. Use the `<paramref>` tag to reference a parameter by name.
    
4. Use the `<see>` tag to reference another member.
    
5. Use the `<c>` tag to format code elements within the documentation comment.
    

By using these XML tags, you can generate API documentation using tools like Sandcastle or Visual Studio's built-in documentation generation.

Here are some common XML tags used for documenting .NET code:

* `<summary>`: Provides a summary of the member's purpose and functionality.
    
* `<param>`: Describes a parameter of a method or constructor.
    
* `<returns>`: Describes the return value of a method or property.
    
* `<value>`: Describes the value of a property.
    
* `<exception>`: Describes an exception that can be thrown by a member.
    
* `<seealso>`: Provides a reference to another type or member.
    
* `<paramref>`: References a parameter by name.
    
* `<typeparam>`: Describes a type parameter of a generic type or method.
    
* `<typeparamref>`: References a type parameter by name.
    
* `<c>`: Formats code elements within the documentation comment.
    
* `<code>`: Formats a code block within the documentation comment.
    
* `<example>`: Provides an example of how to use the member.
    
* `<remarks>`: Provides additional information or clarification about the member.
    

These tags are used to create structured documentation for .NET code that can be consumed by tools like Sandcastle or Visual Studio's built-in documentation generation.

<mark>tools used for documentation comment in visual studio code</mark>

There are several tools that can be used for documenting code in Visual Studio Code. Here are a few popular ones:

1. **XML Documentation Comments**: Visual Studio Code has built-in support for XML documentation comments. When you type "///" above a member declaration, Visual Studio Code will automatically generate a documentation comment with the appropriate tags for the member type.
    
2. **.NET DocFX**: DocFX is a free, open-source documentation generation tool for .NET that can be used to generate API documentation from XML comments. It supports a wide range of output formats, including HTML, Markdown, and PDF.
    
3. **Wyam**: Wyam is another free, open-source documentation generation tool for .NET that can be used to generate API documentation from XML comments. It has a flexible pipeline-based architecture that allows you to customize the documentation generation process to suit your needs.
    
4. **GhostDoc**: GhostDoc is a commercial extension for Visual Studio Code that can be used to generate XML documentation comments for .NET code. It includes a number of templates and snippets that can be used to quickly generate documentation for common code patterns.
    

These tools can help you quickly and easily generate high-quality documentation for your .NET code, making it easier for other developers to understand and use your code.
