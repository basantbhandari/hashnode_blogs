# 20 best practices for react developer

Here are 20 best practices for React developers:

1. Use functional components as much as possible, as they are simpler and easier to reason about.
    
2. Keep your components small and focused on a single responsibility to improve code reusability.
    
3. Use React hooks to manage state and side effects, as they are easier to use and understand than class components.
    
4. Use prop types to specify the type and shape of props passed to your components.
    
5. Use default props to provide default values for props.
    
6. Use conditional rendering to control the visibility of components.
    
7. Use the key prop when rendering arrays of components to help React identify the items that have changed.
    
8. Use controlled components to manage form input.
    
9. Use higher-order components to share behavior between components.
    
10. Use render props to share functionality between components.
    
11. Use the React context API to share the state between components.
    
12. Use pure components or shouldComponentUpdate to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    
13. Use functional programming techniques, such as immutability and pure functions, to write more maintainable code.
    
14. Use the React Developer Tools to debug your code.
    
15. Use ESLint and Prettier to enforce coding standards and ensure consistent code style.
    
16. Use CSS modules or styled-components to scope your CSS to individual components.
    
17. Use lazy loading and code splitting to improve the performance of your application.
    
18. Use React memo or PureComponent to optimize the rendering of components that don't change frequently.
    
19. Use server-side rendering or static site generation to improve the SEO and performance of your application.
