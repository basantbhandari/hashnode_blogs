Mutation and Query are two fundamental operations in GraphQL.

A Query is a GraphQL operation that retrieves data from the server. It is used to read data and does not modify any data on the server. A Query can have multiple fields, and each field corresponds to a particular piece of data that the client is requesting.

On the other hand, a Mutation is a GraphQL operation that modifies data on the server. It is used to create, update, or delete data. Like a Query, a Mutation can have multiple fields, but each field corresponds to a particular mutation operation that the client wants to perform.

In summary, the main difference between a Query and a Mutation is that a Query is used for retrieving data, while a Mutation is used for modifying data.
