Here are 20 common .NET vulnerabilities that developers should be aware of:

1. SQL Injection: This is a type of injection attack where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into a query, leading to data loss or theft.
    
2. Cross-site Scripting (XSS): This is a type of attack where an attacker injects malicious scripts into a web page, leading to information disclosure or theft.
    
3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): This is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application where they are currently authenticated.
    
4. Broken Authentication and Session Management: This vulnerability arises when an attacker can bypass authentication or access user sessions due to weak or predictable session IDs.
    
5. XML External Entities (XXE): This vulnerability allows an attacker to read sensitive data, execute remote code, and perform denial-of-service attacks.
    
6. Broken Access Control: This is a vulnerability that allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
    
7. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: This vulnerability arises when an application does not log or monitor important security-related events, making it difficult to detect attacks or suspicious activities.
    
8. Insecure Cryptographic Storage: This vulnerability arises when an application stores sensitive information, such as passwords or keys, in an unencrypted or weakly encrypted format.
    
9. Insufficient Input Validation: This vulnerability arises when an application does not validate input data properly, leading to potential buffer overflows, denial-of-service attacks, or other vulnerabilities.
    
10. Insecure Communication: This vulnerability arises when an application uses insecure communication protocols, such as HTTP instead of HTTPS, leading to information disclosure or theft.
    
11. Code Injection: This is a type of attack where an attacker can inject malicious code into a program or application, leading to data loss or theft.
    
12. Directory Traversal: This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to files and directories by manipulating user input.
    
13. Open Redirect: This vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect a user to a malicious site by manipulating user input.
    
14. Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards: This vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect a user to a malicious site or execute a phishing attack by manipulating user input.
    
15. Clickjacking: This is a type of attack where an attacker can trick a user into clicking on a hidden or invisible link, leading to unauthorized access or data loss.
    
16. Remote File Inclusion: This is a type of attack where an attacker can include remote files in an application, leading to remote code execution or information disclosure.
    
17. Buffer Overflow: This is a type of attack where an attacker can overflow a buffer with too much data, leading to code execution or a system crash.
    
18. Race Condition: This is a type of vulnerability where the behavior of an application depends on the order in which multiple processes or threads are executed, leading to unpredictable results.
    
19. Memory Corruption: This is a type of attack where an attacker can manipulate memory in an application, leading to code execution or system crash.
    
20. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack: This is a type of attack where an attacker can intercept communication between two parties, leading to information disclosure or theft.
