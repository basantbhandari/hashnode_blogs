In Angular, template statements are used to define event bindings that respond to user actions, such as clicks, keystrokes, and form submissions. They allow you to define a JavaScript expression or call a method in response to an event in the template.

Template statements are enclosed in parentheses and followed by the event name, like this:

```typescript
<button (click)="onButtonClick()">Click me</button>
```

In this example, the `(click)` event binding is used to call the `onButtonClick()` method when the button is clicked.

Template statements can include any valid JavaScript expression or method call, and can reference variables, properties, and methods defined in the component's TypeScript code.

Here's an example of using a template statement to bind to a form submission event and call a method to handle the form data:

```typescript
<form (submit)="onSubmit(formData)">
  <input type="text" name="name" [(ngModel)]="formData.name">
  <input type="email" name="email" [(ngModel)]="formData.email">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

In this example, the `(submit)` event binding is used to call the `onSubmit(formData)` method when the form is submitted, passing in the `formData` object as an argument. The `[(ngModel)]` directive is used to bind the form input values to properties of the `formData` object.

Overall, template statements are a powerful feature of Angular's templating system that allow you to define rich, interactive UIs that respond to user actions.
