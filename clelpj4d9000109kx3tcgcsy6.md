# DBcontext vs DBset

DbContext is the main class in Entity Framework that represents a session with the database. It is responsible for managing database connections, mapping database tables to .NET classes, and tracking changes to objects. DbContext provides a number of methods for querying and updating data, including SaveChanges(), which is used to persist changes made to objects back to the database.

DbSet is a class in Entity Framework that represents a collection of objects from a single database table or view. It provides a number of methods for querying and updating data, including Add(), Remove(), and Find(). DbSet also provides the ability to execute LINQ queries against the underlying database table or view.

In other words, DbContext is used to manage the database connection and track changes to objects across multiple tables, while DbSet is used to represent a specific table or view and provides methods for querying and updating data within that table or view.

Together, DbContext and DbSet provide a powerful and flexible way to work with data in Entity Framework. Developers can use DbContext to manage the overall data access session, and then use DbSet to interact with specific tables or views within the session. This approach allows for a high degree of abstraction and flexibility when working with complex data models and database schemas.
