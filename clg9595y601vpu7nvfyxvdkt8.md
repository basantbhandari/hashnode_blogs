In a recent research article, Sheryl Sandberg and her colleagues examined how women are perceived when they take on leadership roles. The authors found that women in leadership positions are often seen as competent but not likable, and that this double bind can have negative consequences for their careers.

The authors conducted two studies to examine how women in leadership positions are perceived. In the first study, the authors asked participants to read a description of a male or female leader and rate the leader on various dimensions, including competence and likability. The authors found that female leaders were rated as more competent than male leaders, but they were also rated as less likable.

In the second study, the authors asked participants to read a description of a male or female leader and rate the leader on various dimensions, including warmth and competence. The authors found that female leaders were rated as more competent than male leaders, but they were also rated as less warm.

The authors suggest that the double bind of being seen as competent but not likable can have negative consequences for women in leadership positions. The authors suggest that organizations can help to mitigate these effects by promoting a more positive view of women leaders.
