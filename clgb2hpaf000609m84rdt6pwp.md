It has also invested in e-commerce companies, such as Flipkart, which was acquired by Walmart for $16 billion in 2018.

Coleman has been successful in part because he has been able to identify emerging trends before they become mainstream. For example, he was an early investor in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which has since become one of the largest companies in the world. He has also been bullish on the Indian e-commerce market and has made significant investments in companies such as Flipkart and MakeMyTrip.

In recent years, Coleman has shifted his focus to investments in fintech companies. He has made investments in companies such as Stripe, Brex, and Robinhood, which have disrupted traditional financial services. He believes that fintech has the potential to transform the financial industry in the same way that e-commerce transformed the retail industry.
