on his life and work

Charles Thomas Munger (born January 1, 1924) is an American business magnate, lawyer, investor, and philanthropist. He is the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett. Munger is also the chairman of the Daily Journal Corporation, based in Los Angeles, California, and a director of Costco Wholesale Corporation.

Munger was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and grew up in a family with a strong interest in business and investing. His father, Alfred Munger, was a lawyer and Republican politician. Charles' uncle, Walter Munger, was a wealthy businessman who owned a wholesale grocery business, among other interests.

Charles Munger's first job was delivering newspapers for the Omaha World-Herald. He later worked as a grocery clerk. In 1942, he interrupted his education to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps. After the war, he returned to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and a minor in physics. He then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 1948.

After law school, Munger worked for a short time as a lawyer. He soon decided to go into business, and in 1951 he and his father purchased a controlling interest in a struggling California-based real estate development company called Blue Chip Stamps. Over the next few years, Munger and his father turned the company around, and it became a very successful business. In 1962, Warren Buffett, who was already a successful investor, approached Munger about buying a stake in Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company. Munger agreed, and Berkshire Hathaway soon became one of the most successful companies in the world.

In addition to his work at Berkshire Hathaway, Munger is also the chairman of the Daily Journal Corporation, a newspaper publishing company. He is also a director of Costco Wholesale Corporation.

Munger is known for his investing philosophy, which is based on the ideas of value investing and contrarianism. He has often said that the best way to make money is to "buy a wonderful company at a fair price and hold it for the long term."

Munger is also known for his wit and wisdom. He is often quoted on a variety of topics, ranging from investing to business to life in general. Some of his most famous quotes include:

"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."

"I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines. They go to bed every night a little wiser than they were when they got up and boy does that help, particularly when you have a long run ahead of you."

"It is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong."

"The big money is not in the buying or the selling, but in the waiting."

"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."

"You don't need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with 130 IQ."

"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."

"I insist on a lot of time being spent, almost every day, to just sit and think. That is very uncommon in American business. I read and think. So I do more reading and thinking, and make less impulse decisions than most people in business. I do it because I like this kind of life."

"The first rule is not to lose. The second rule is not to forget the first rule."

"It's not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results."

"You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don't do too many things wrong."

"I think I've been in the top five percent of my age cohort all my life in understanding the power of compounding interest."

"The way to make money is to buy when blood is running in the streets."

"I believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have ever figured out. That's why I read as much as I do."

"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."

"The big money is not in the buying or the selling, but in the waiting."
