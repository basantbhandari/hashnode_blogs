In Angular, the `ngFor` the directive is used to render a template for each item in a collection. It is similar to the `for...of` loop in JavaScript, but it is specifically designed for iterating over arrays or objects in a template.

The `ngFor` the directive takes an input in the form of an iterable expression, such as an array or object, and generates a template for each item in the iterable. You can also use the `index` variable to get the current index of the item in the iterable.

Here's an example of using the `ngFor` directive to iterate over an array of items:

```typescript
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let item of items; index as i">{{ i + 1 }}. {{ item }}</li>
</ul>
```

In this example, the `ngFor` directive is used with the `*` syntax, which is called a "structural directive". The `let` keyword is used to define a local variable `item` for each item in the `items` array, and the `index as i` syntax is used to define a local variable `i` to represent the index of the current item.

The `ngFor` directive generates an `li` element for each item in the `items` array and the index of each item is displayed with the item's value.

The `ngFor` the directive is commonly used in Angular templates to display lists of data, such as a list of items fetched from a server or a list of options in a dropdown menu. It can also be used to generate dynamic forms or tables based on a data source.
