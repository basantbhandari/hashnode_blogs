In this blog, we will examine the Adani vs Hindenburg report case and the implications of the report for the Adani Group.

The report also claimed that the company's financial position was overstated and that its accounting practices were opaque. The report sent shockwaves through the investment community and raised serious questions about the Adani Group's business practices.
