here are 10 Observable updates in the latest version of Angular (Angular 12 as of my knowledge cutoff date):

1. RxJS Version 6: Angular 12 uses RxJS version 6, which provides better performance and smaller bundle sizes.
    
2. Strict Mode: Angular 12 introduced strict mode, which provides better type checking and can catch more errors at compile-time, including errors related to Observables.
    
3. Improved Tree-Shaking: Angular 12 includes improved tree-shaking, which can help reduce the size of your application by removing unused code, including unused Observable operators.
    
4. New `markDirty()` Method: Angular 12 introduced a new `markDirty()` method that can be used to manually trigger change detection for a component, including changes to Observables.
    
5. New `asapScheduler` Operator: Angular 12 introduced a new `asapScheduler` operator, which can be used to schedule Observables to run as soon as possible.
    
6. Improved `HttpClient` Error Handling: Angular 12 includes improved error handling for the `HttpClient` service, including better support for error handling with Observables.
    
7. Improved `async` Pipe: Angular 12 includes improved performance and better error handling for the `async` pipe, which can be used to bind Observables to templates.
    
8. Improved `takeUntil` Operator: Angular 12 includes improvements to the `takeUntil` operator, which can be used to unsubscribe from an Observable when a specified condition is met.
    
9. Improved TypeScript Support: Angular 12 includes improved TypeScript support, including better type checking for Observables and Observable operators.
    
10. New `stopOnDestroy` Operator: Angular 12 introduced a new `stopOnDestroy` operator, which can be used to automatically unsubscribe from an Observable when a component is destroyed.
    

Overall, these updates to Observables in Angular 12 provide several performance improvements, better error handling, and new features that can help developers create more efficient and robust applications.
