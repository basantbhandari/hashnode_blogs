Nelson Mandela was born in 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then a part of South Africa's Cape Province. His father, Henry Mandela, was a chief of the Tembu people. His mother, Nosekeni Fanny, was the third of Henry's four wives. Mandela was the firstborn of his mother's four children. He had two sisters and one brother. His father died when Mandela was nine, and he and his siblings were placed in the care of their mother's relatives.

Mandela attended primary school in Qunu, where he excelled. He later recalled that one of his teachers, Ms. Mdingane, "was the first person to ever teach me that it was good to learn." Ms. Mdingane instilled in him a love of learning and a respect for all people, regardless of race.

In 1937, Mandela began his studies at the University of Fort Hare, one of the few institutions of higher learning open to black South Africans at that time. He was an excellent student, but he was also active in student politics. In his second year at Fort Hare, he was elected president of the Student Representative Council.

Mandela's time at Fort Hare was cut short when he was expelled for taking part in a student protest. He then returned to Qunu, where he worked for a time as a clerk for the chief of his tribe.

In 1941, Mandela moved to Johannesburg to live with his cousin, and to look for work. He found a job as an articled clerk at a law firm. He also began to study law by correspondence through the University of South Africa.

In 1943, Mandela joined the African National Congress (ANC), a political party that was fighting for the rights of black South Africans. The following year, he married Evelyn Mase, a nurse. The couple had four children: Madiba Thembekile (born 1946), Makgatho Lewanika (1950), Makaziwe (1952), and Zenani (1957).

In 1944, Mandela helped to establish the ANC Youth League, of which he became the president the following year. He quickly became one of the most outspoken and influential leaders of the black resistance movement in South Africa.

In 1948, the National Party came to power in South Africa and began implementing its policy of apartheid, or racial segregation. Under apartheid, black South Africans were denied basic rights and forced to live in separate, underdeveloped areas.

Mandela opposed apartheid, and he dedicated his life to fighting it. In the 1950s, he helped to organize a number of protests and campaigns against the apartheid regime. He also helped to establish the Defiance Campaign, in which people of all races defied the unjust laws of the government.

In 1952, Mandela was arrested and sentenced to nine months in prison for his role in the Defiance Campaign. While in prison, he continued his studies and was awarded a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of London.

After his release from prison, Mandela became increasingly involved in the ANC's armed resistance movement. In 1961, he helped to establish Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the military wing of the ANC.

In 1962, Mandela was arrested and charged with sabotage. He was sentenced to life in prison, and he spent the next 27 years behind bars.

While in prison, Mandela became a symbol of the struggle against apartheid. He was widely respected by both his fellow prisoners and his guards. He was also nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize five times.

In 1990, Mandela was released from prison. He resumed his work with the ANC, and he helped to negotiate an end to apartheid. In 1994, he was elected the first black president of South Africa in the country's first democratic elections.

As president, Mandela worked to promote reconciliation and racial harmony in South Africa. He also worked to improve the lives of black South Africans by increasing access to education, housing, and health care.

In 1999, Mandela retired from politics. He continued to work for peace and social justice, and he remained a beloved figure both in South Africa and around the world.

Mandela died on December 5, 2013, at the age of 95. His life and work continue to inspire people all over the world.
