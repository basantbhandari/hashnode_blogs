AOT compilation is a ahead-of-time compilation process that compiles Angular HTML and TypeScript code into native JavaScript code during the build phase. This is in contrast to just-in-time compilation, which compiles Angular HTML and TypeScript code into JavaScript code when the application is run.

AOT compilation has a number of benefits, including:

- Reduced application size
- Reduced application startup time
- Reduced application runtime errors
- Improved security
- Improved application performance
