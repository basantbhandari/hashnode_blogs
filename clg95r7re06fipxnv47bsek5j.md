Jair Bolsonaro (born March 21, 1955) is a Brazilian politician and retired military officer who is currently serving as the 38th President of Brazil. He was a member of the Chamber of Deputies from 1991 to 2018, representing the state of Rio de Janeiro, and he is a member of the Social Liberal Party (PSL). 

Bolsonaro was born in Glicério, São Paulo, to Emília Bolsonaro (née Martins), a homemaker, and Olívio Bolsonaro, a lower-middle-class businessman who owned a small general store in the town. He was raised Catholic. His father was of Italian descent, while his mother was of German, Swiss, and indigenous Brazilian ancestry. He has three brothers and two sisters. When he was seven years old, his family moved to the city of Duque de Caxias in the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area.

Bolsonaro graduated from the Escola de Formação de Oficiais da Reserva do Exército in 1977, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He served in the Brazilian Army's Paratrooper Brigade. He later graduated from the Agulhas Negras Military Academy in 1980, where he was promoted to the rank of captain. He was later posted to the 21st Jungle Infantry Battalion in Urucu, Amazonas.

Bolsonaro was first elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1990, representing the state of Rio de Janeiro. He was re-elected in 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014. He ran for the Senate in the 2018 elections, but was defeated.

Bolsonaro has been a vocal critic of the Workers' Party (PT), and has been accused of being a reactionary and a far-right populist. He has been described as a nationalist, and has been an outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage, abortion, and drug liberalization. He has also been critical of affirmative action and has been accused of racism and homophobia.

In October 2018, Bolsonaro was stabbed while campaigning for the presidency in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais. He underwent surgery and was released from the hospital a few days later.

Bolsonaro was elected president in the second round of voting on October 28, 2018, with 55.1% of the vote. He was inaugurated on January 1, 2019.

Since taking office, Bolsonaro has been embroiled in a number of controversies. In February 2019, he fired the head of the Brazilian Space Agency, after she had been critical of his administration's budget cuts to the agency. In March 2019, he sparked international outrage after he joked that a female journalist was too ugly to be raped.

In May 2019, Bolsonaro's government was criticized for its handling of the Amazon rainforest fires. Bolsonaro has been accused of downplaying the fires and of promoting deforestation in the Amazon.

In September 2019, Bolsonaro was accused of interfering in the federal police's investigation into the murder of councilwoman Marielle Franco. Franco, a black woman and human rights activist, was gunned down in Rio de Janeiro in March 2018.

Bolsonaro has been a divisive figure, and his presidency has been marked by mass protests both for and against his administration.
