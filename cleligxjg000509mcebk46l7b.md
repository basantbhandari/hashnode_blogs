# what are the assembly and its type in dotnet

In .NET, assembly refers to a compiled code library that contains one or more files, typically with a .dll or .exe file extension. Assemblies in .NET are the building blocks of applications and can be deployed and versioned independently.

There are two types of assemblies in .NET:

1. Private assemblies: Private assemblies are local to an application and can only be accessed by that application. They are typically stored in the same directory as the application executable.
    
2. Shared assemblies: Shared assemblies can be accessed by multiple applications and are stored in a central location called the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). Shared assemblies have a strong name, which includes a version number, public key, and other information to ensure uniqueness and security.
    

Assemblies can be created using different programming languages in .NET, such as C#, Visual Basic .NET, or F#. They can also be created using different development tools such as Visual Studio, .NET Core CLI, or MSBuild.
