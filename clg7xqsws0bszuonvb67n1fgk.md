Dependency injection is a technique used to create loosely coupled code. In Angular, dependency injection is used to provide services to modules and components. These services can be used to perform certain tasks, such as fetching data from a server, logging messages, or validating user input. Angular provides a number of built-in services that can be injected into modules and components.
