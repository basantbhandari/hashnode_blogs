Angular applications can be tested using a variety of tools and frameworks. Here are some commonly used tools for testing Angular applications:

1. Jasmine: Jasmine is a popular testing framework for JavaScript that is often used for testing Angular applications. It provides a set of functions for defining and executing test cases, and it can be integrated with other tools such as Karma and Protractor.
    
2. Karma: Karma is a test runner that is used to execute tests in multiple browsers and environments. It integrates with Jasmine and other testing frameworks, and it can be used to generate code coverage reports and other metrics.
    
3. Protractor: Protractor is an end-to-end testing framework for Angular applications. It simulates user interactions with the application and verifies that the application behaves correctly in different scenarios.
    
4. TestBed: TestBed is a utility provided by Angular that is used to create and configure instances of components, services, and other Angular constructs for testing purposes.
    
5. Cypress: Cypress is a testing tool that allows you to write end-to-end tests that run in the browser. It provides an easy-to-use API for interacting with web elements, making it easy to test complex scenarios and interactions.
    
6. Jest: Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript that can be used for testing Angular applications. It provides a fast and easy-to-use test runner, and it can be used to generate code coverage reports and other metrics.
    

Overall, there are many tools available for testing Angular applications, and the choice of tool will depend on the specific needs of the project. Jasmine, Karma, and Protractor are commonly used tools for unit and end-to-end testing, while TestBed and Cypress are often used for more complex scenarios.
