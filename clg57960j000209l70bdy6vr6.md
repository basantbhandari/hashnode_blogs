here are 20 differences between Angular and AngularJS:

1. Architecture: AngularJS uses a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, while Angular uses a component-based architecture.
    
2. Syntax: AngularJS uses JavaScript syntax with custom directives and expressions, while Angular uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, with Angular-specific syntax and decorators.
    
3. Data binding: AngularJS uses a two-way data binding system, while Angular uses a unidirectional data flow system.
    
4. Rendering engine: AngularJS uses a simple DOM-based rendering engine, while Angular uses a more advanced, optimized rendering engine that improves performance.
    
5. Mobile support: Angular includes built-in support for mobile development and progressive web apps, while AngularJS does not have native mobile support.
    
6. Scalability: Angular is designed to be more scalable than AngularJS, with features like lazy loading and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.
    
7. Modularity: Angular encourages modular development with features like NgModule and lazy loading, while AngularJS is more monolithic.
    
8. Performance: Angular is generally faster and more efficient than AngularJS due to its improved rendering engine and optimized change detection system.
    
9. Dependency injection: Angular has a powerful dependency injection system that makes it easy to manage dependencies and inject services into components, while AngularJS has a simpler, less robust system.
    
10. TypeScript: Angular uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, which offers additional features like static typing and improved tooling.
    
11. Routing: Angular has a powerful built-in routing system, while AngularJS requires the use of external libraries.
    
12. Animation: Angular has a built-in animation system, while AngularJS requires the use of external libraries.
    
13. Tooling: Angular has a rich set of tools and development environments, including Angular CLI, while AngularJS has less robust tooling.
    
14. Code organization: Angular encourages best practices for code organization, such as using modules and services, while AngularJS leaves this up to the developer.
    
15. Development speed: Angular is generally slower to develop with due to its more complex architecture and syntax, while AngularJS is quicker to set up and get started with.
    
16. Testing: Angular includes a built-in testing framework and encourages testing best practices, while AngularJS does not have built-in testing support.
    
17. Directives: Angular has a simplified and more consistent approach to directives compared to AngularJS.
    
18. Pipes: Angular has built-in support for pipes, which allow you to transform data in your templates, while AngularJS does not have this feature.
    
19. Change detection: Angular uses a more efficient change detection system that only updates the parts of the view that have changed, while AngularJS updates the entire view every time data changes.
    
20. Versioning: Angular follows a semantic versioning scheme, while AngularJS does not, making it easier to understand changes and updates to the framework.
