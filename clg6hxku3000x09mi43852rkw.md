Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern in which objects receive dependencies from an external source rather than creating them internally. In Angular, the DI pattern is used to provide services and other objects to components that need them.

Angular's DI system is responsible for managing the creation and injection of objects within an application. The system provides a way for components to declare their dependencies on other objects, such as services, and then automatically injects those dependencies when the component is created.

To use dependency injection in Angular, you need to follow these steps:

1. Define a service - A service is a class that provides some functionality that can be shared across different components or other services. You can define a service using the `@Injectable` decorator.
    
2. Declare a dependency - To declare a dependency, you need to add it to the constructor of the component or service that needs it. For example, if a component needs access to a service, you would add the service as a parameter to the constructor.
    
3. Provide the dependency - To provide the dependency, you need to register the service with the Angular DI system. This can be done at the component level, the module level, or the application level, depending on your needs.
    
4. Use the dependency - Once the dependency is provided, you can use it within the component or service by simply accessing it through the property or method that you declared in the constructor.
    

By using dependency injection in Angular, you can easily manage the relationships between different objects in your application, and make your code more modular, testable, and maintainable.
