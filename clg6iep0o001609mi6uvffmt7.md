Animations can add visual interest and improve the user experience in an Angular application. Here are the general steps to perform animations in Angular:

1. Import the required modules: To use animations in an Angular application, you need to import the `BrowserAnimationsModule` or `NoopAnimationsModule` module in your app module.
    
2. Define the animation: Animations in Angular are defined using the `@angular/animations` library. You can define animations in your component file using the `trigger`, `state`, `style`, and `transition` functions.
    
3. Apply the animation: You can apply an animation to an element in your component template using the `[@animationName]` syntax. For example, to apply an animation called `fade` to a button element, you would add `[@fade]` to the button tag.
    
4. Trigger the animation: You can trigger an animation by changing the state of the element. For example, to trigger a fade animation when a button is clicked, you would add `(click)="isButtonClicked = true"` to the button tag, and then add a transition from the initial state to the final state in the animation definition.
    
5. Fine-tune the animation: You can further customize your animations by using keyframes, delays, and easing functions. The `@angular/animations` library provides a variety of options for fine-tuning your animations.
    

Overall, performing animations in Angular involves importing the required modules, defining the animation using the `@angular/animations` library, applying the animation to an element in your component template, triggering the animation by changing the element's state, and fine-tuning the animation using additional options.
