The hippocampus is a brain region that is essential for memory and navigation. Damage to the hippocampus can lead to memory loss and disorientation.

The hippocampus is located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain. It is divided into two regions: the dentate gyrus and the cornu ammonis. The dentate gyrus is involved in the encoding of new memories, while the cornu ammonis is involved in the consolidation of memories.

The hippocampus is believed to be important for navigation because it is involved in the encoding of spatial information. Damage to the hippocampus can lead to disorientation and memory loss.

The hippocampus is also involved in emotion and stress. Damage to the hippocampus can lead to emotional problems and increased stress.
