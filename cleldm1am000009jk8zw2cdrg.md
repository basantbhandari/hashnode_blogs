# String and StringBuilder in dotnet

In .NET, String, and StringBuilder are also classes that represent sequences of characters, and they share many similarities with their Java counterparts. However, there are some differences in how they are implemented and used in .NET.

String objects in .NET are also immutable, meaning that once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed. Like in Java, any operation that appears to modify a String actually creates a new String object with the modified value. String objects in .NET are also thread-safe, and they can be safely shared between multiple threads.

StringBuilder in .NET is also mutable, and it provides methods to modify the characters in the sequence without creating a new object. StringBuilder in .NET is similar to StringBuilder in Java, and it is often used when a large number of modifications are needed to a string.

One notable difference between Java and .NET is the way that strings are interned. In Java, string literals are automatically interned, meaning that multiple references to the same string literal will point to the same object. In .NET, string literals are not automatically interned, but you can use the `String.Intern` method to explicitly intern strings.
