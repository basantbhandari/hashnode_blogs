# difference between process and thread

In computing, both processes and threads are related to the execution of code in a computer system, but they differ in their fundamental characteristics:

1. Definition: A process is a program that is being executed by a computer system, which includes the code, data, and system resources associated with the program. A thread is a unit of execution within a process, which includes a separate program counter, stack, and set of registers.
    
2. Resource allocation: Each process has its own virtual memory address space, system resources, and file handles, which are allocated by the operating system. Threads, on the other hand, share the virtual memory address space and system resources of the process in which they are running.
    
3. Multitasking: Multiple processes can run concurrently on a computer system, each with its own dedicated resources and system time slice. Threads, on the other hand, share the CPU time slice of the process in which they are running and can run concurrently with other threads in the same process.
    
4. Communication: Processes can communicate with each other through inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, such as pipes, sockets, and shared memory. Threads can communicate with each other through shared memory, but they can also share data through the process's global data space.
    
5. Fault tolerance: In general, processes are more fault-tolerant than threads, as a crash or error in one process does not affect the other processes running on the system. In contrast, a crash or error in one thread can potentially affect other threads running in the same process.
    

In summary, processes are independent units of execution that can run concurrently on a computer system, while threads are lightweight units of execution that run within a process and share its resources. Processes provide greater fault tolerance and isolation, while threads provide more efficient multitasking and communication within a process.
