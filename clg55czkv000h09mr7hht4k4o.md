An Angular application works by following a component-based architecture that separates the application into reusable, modular pieces. These pieces, called components, are built using HTML templates, CSS styles, and TypeScript code, and they can be combined to create complex, interactive user interfaces.

When an Angular application is loaded in a web browser, the Angular framework bootstraps the application and creates an initial component tree based on the application's root component. The root component is defined in the app module, which is the entry point of the application.

As users interact with the application, Angular updates the component tree to reflect changes in the application's state. This process is driven by the application's data model, which is managed using services and observables.

Angular also provides a set of built-in directives, such as *ngFor and* ngIf, that allow developers to manipulate the component tree based on the application's data model. These directives are used to create dynamic, data-driven views that update in real time as the application's data changes.

Additionally, Angular provides a powerful set of tools for handling user input, managing application state, and communicating with external APIs. This includes features such as forms, routing, dependency injection, and HTTP services.

Finally, Angular provides a comprehensive testing framework that allows developers to write unit tests and end-to-end tests to ensure the correctness and stability of their applications.
