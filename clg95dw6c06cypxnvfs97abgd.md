Ada Lovelace is often credited as the world's first computer programmer, and her research article "On the Analytical Engine" is considered to be the first published description of a computer program. In the article, Lovelace describes how the Analytical Engine could be used to compute Bernoulli numbers, and she includes a method for doing so. This article is significant not only for its historical value, but also for its insights into early computer programming.
