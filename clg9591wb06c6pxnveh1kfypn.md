, “The Impact of the Financial Crisis on the U.S. Economy,”

The financial crisis that began in 2007 had a profound impact on the U.S. economy. The crisis was marked by a sharp increase in the cost of borrowing and a decrease in the availability of credit. This led to a sharp decline in economic activity and a rise in unemployment. The financial crisis also had a significant impact on the federal budget. The budget deficit increased from $161 billion in 2007 to $1.3 trillion in 2009. The federal debt rose from $9.0 trillion in 2007 to $14.3 trillion in 2010. The crisis also led to a decline in tax revenues and an increase in government spending. The combination of these factors led to a sharp increase in the federal deficit. The deficit increased from 2.8 percent of GDP in 2007 to 9.8 percent of GDP in 2009. The increase in the deficit was due to a combination of factors, including the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003, the increase in government spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the impact of the financial crisis on the economy. The deficit remained at a high level in 2010 and 2011, but it began to decline in 2012. The deficit is projected to decline to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2013.
