OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows third-party applications to access a user's resources without having to know their login credentials or gain access to sensitive data. It works by enabling users to grant access to their resources to another application, without actually sharing their credentials.

Here's a high-level overview of how OAuth 2.0 works:

1. The user initiates an action that requires authorization, such as logging into an application or accessing a protected resource.
    
2. The application requests authorization from the user, typically by redirecting the user to an authorization server, which is responsible for handling the authorization process.
    
3. The authorization server prompts the user to enter their login credentials or otherwise authenticate themselves.
    
4. Once the user has been authenticated, the authorization server presents them with a consent screen that explains what data the application is requesting access to and what actions it will be able to perform.
    
5. If the user consents to the request, the authorization server generates an access token and redirects the user back to the application along with the access token.
    
6. The application can then use the access token to access the user's resources, such as their profile information, without having to know their login credentials.
    
7. The access token typically has an expiration time, and the application may need to obtain a new token when the old one expires.
    

Overall, OAuth 2.0 provides a way for applications to access user resources in a secure and standardized way, without requiring users to share their credentials with third-party applications. This helps to improve security and privacy for users, while also enabling more seamless integration between different applications and services.
