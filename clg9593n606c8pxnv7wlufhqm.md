In an article published in the Harvard Business Review, Sir Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, discusses the importance of customer service. He states that providing good customer service is one of the most important things a company can do in order to be successful. He goes on to say that happy customers are more likely to continue doing business with a company, and they are also more likely to recommend the company to others.

Branson provides several examples of how his own companies have provided excellent customer service, including a story about how Virgin Atlantic went above and beyond to help a stranded passenger. He also talks about the importance of training employees to be able to provide good customer service.

In conclusion, Branson says that companies should always remember that the customer is always right, and that they should do everything they can to make sure their customers are happy.
