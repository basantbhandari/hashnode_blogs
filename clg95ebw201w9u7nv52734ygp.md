on the history of the internet

In the early days of the internet, there was no such thing as a “web browser”. There were only text-based terminals that could access a handful of text-based websites. The first graphical web browser, Mosaic, was created in 1993. This was quickly followed by the release of Netscape Navigator in 1994.

The release of these two web browsers marked the beginning of the “browser wars”, as Netscape and Microsoft fought for supremacy in the market.

In the end, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer won out and became the dominant web browser. However, the browser wars had a lasting effect on the internet. They led to the development of standards that would ensure that all web browsers could display web pages in the same way.

These standards, known as HTML and CSS, are still in use today.
