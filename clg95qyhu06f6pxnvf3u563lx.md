He ran for president in 1988 and 2008, but he withdrew from the 1988 race after allegations of plagiarism and from the 2008 race after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucus.

In February 2009, Biden was sworn in as the 44th Vice President of the United States, making him the first Catholic to ever hold the office.

Biden attended Archmere Academy, a Catholic high school, and then the University of Delaware, where he earned a bachelor's degree in history and political science in 1965. He then attended Syracuse University Law School, graduating in 1968.

After law school, Biden returned to Delaware and began working as a lawyer. In 1972, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history. Biden was reelected to the Senate six times, and he served as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

In 2007, Biden announced his candidacy for president, but he withdrew from the race after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucus. In 2008, he endorsed Barack Obama for president, and he was selected as Obama's running mate. In 2012, Biden was reelected to a second term as Vice President.
