# what is the partial view in MVC

In [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC, a partial view is a reusable view component that can be used to display a specific portion of a web page. Partial views are essentially smaller, self-contained views that can be rendered inside a larger view or shared between multiple views. This can help to improve code organization, reduce duplication, and make it easier to maintain and modify the code.

To create a partial view, you can create a new view file with the .cshtml extension (or .vbhtml for Visual Basic), just like you would for a regular view. However, instead of using the full layout of a web page, a partial view typically contains only the HTML, Razor syntax, or other code needed to render a specific section of the page.

You can render a partial view inside a regular view or another partial view using the Html.Partial() or Html.RenderPartial() methods. For example, if you have a partial view named "\_MyPartialView.cshtml", you can render it inside another view like this:

```csharp
@Html.Partial("_MyPartialView")
```

When the view is rendered, the partial view will be included and rendered in place of the @Html.Partial() or @Html.RenderPartial() method call.

Partial views can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as displaying a list of items, rendering a navigation menu, or displaying a search form. They can also be used to break down a large view into smaller, more manageable components that can be reused across multiple pages.
