Property binding is a feature in Angular 12 that allows you to set the value of an element property to a value in the component. In other words, it is a way to pass data from the component to the template.

Property binding is important in Angular 12 for several reasons:

1. Dynamic Data Binding: Property binding allows you to dynamically bind data to HTML elements. This means that you can display data that changes over time, such as user input or data from an API.
    
2. Flexibility: Property binding allows you to set a wide range of HTML element properties, such as text content, style properties, and attributes.
    
3. Two-Way Binding: Property binding can be used for two-way data binding, which allows you to bind both the data source and the user input to the same HTML element.
    
4. Simplified Syntax: Property binding uses a simplified syntax that allows you to bind a value to a property using square brackets (`[ ]`).
    
5. Separation of Concerns: Property binding allows you to separate the presentation of data from the logic that generates it. This can make your code more modular and easier to maintain.
    

Overall, property binding is an essential feature in Angular 12 that allows you to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It provides a flexible and powerful way to pass data between the component and the template and can be used for both one-way and two-way data binding.
