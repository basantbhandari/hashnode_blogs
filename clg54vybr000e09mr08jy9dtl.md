Angular is a JavaScript framework for building dynamic, single-page web applications. It is maintained by Google and was initially released in 2010 as AngularJS, but a major rewrite of the framework resulted in the release of Angular in 2016.

Angular uses declarative templates, dependency injection, and a component-based architecture to make it easier to build complex, interactive applications. It also provides a powerful set of tools for building responsive user interfaces, handling data, and managing application state.

Angular is designed to be used with other libraries and tools, and it has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the framework and create extensions and plugins to enhance its functionality.
