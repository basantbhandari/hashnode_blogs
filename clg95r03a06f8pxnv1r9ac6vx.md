Margaret Thatcher was the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. She was born in 1925 in Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. Her father, Alfred Roberts, was a grocer and alderman, and her mother, Beatrice Ethel, was a hairdresser. Thatcher was educated at Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School and then won a scholarship to study chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford.

After graduating, Thatcher worked as a research chemist for BX Plastics. She later trained as a barrister and was called to the Bar in 1954. Thatcher first stood for Parliament in 1950, but was unsuccessful. She was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Finchley in 1959.

As an MP, Thatcher supported free-market policies and opposed socialism. She also campaigned for Britain to join the European Economic Community (EEC). In 1970, she was appointed Secretary of State for Education and Science by Prime Minister Edward Heath.

As Education Secretary, Thatcher implemented controversial policies such as introducing tuition fees and abolishing free milk for schoolchildren. These policies made her unpopular with the public, but she was seen as a competent minister by her colleagues.

In 1974, Heath was ousted as Prime Minister and replaced by Harold Wilson. Thatcher was made Shadow Chancellor (Opposition spokesperson on finance). In 1975, she was elected Leader of the Conservative Party, becoming the first woman to lead a major political party in the UK.

As Leader of the Opposition, Thatcher opposed the Labour government's policies of nationalisation and state intervention in the economy. In the 1979 general election, the Conservative Party won a landslide victory and Thatcher became Prime Minister.

As Prime Minister, Thatcher pursued a policy of privatisation and deregulation. She also reduced the power of the trade unions. In 1982, she ordered the invasion of the Falkland Islands after Argentina invaded the territory. The Falklands War was a success and boosted Thatcher's popularity.

In 1984, Thatcher won a second general election with a reduced majority. The following year, she survived an assassination attempt by the Irish Republican Army (IRA).

 Thatcher's second term was marked by economic difficulties, as well as growing unpopularity due to her policies on taxation, education and the environment. In 1990, she was ousted as Conservative Party Leader by her own MPs. She resigned as Prime Minister and was succeeded by John Major.

After leaving office, Thatcher retired from politics and wrote her memoirs. She died in 2013, aged 87.
