Angular is a web framework that is built on top of several technologies. The primary technologies used in Angular are:

1. TypeScript: Angular is written in TypeScript, which is a typed superset of JavaScript that adds features such as type checking, interfaces, and classes.
    
2. HTML: Angular uses HTML templates to define the structure of web pages and components.
    
3. CSS: Angular uses CSS to define the styles and appearance of web pages and components.
    
4. RxJS: RxJS is a library for reactive programming in JavaScript. Angular uses RxJS for handling asynchronous operations such as HTTP requests.
    
5. Zone.js: Zone.js is a library for managing asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Angular uses Zone.js to detect and track changes to the application state.
    
6. Webpack: Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript. Angular uses Webpack to package and optimize the application code.
    
7. Jasmine: Jasmine is a behavior-driven testing framework for JavaScript. Angular uses Jasmine for unit testing.
    
8. Karma: Karma is a test runner for JavaScript. Angular uses Karma to run tests in different browsers and environments.
    
9. Protractor: Protractor is an end-to-end testing framework for Angular applications. It runs tests in a real browser and simulates user interactions.
