on the effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement

In a research article published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, Wilbur Ross examines the effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on the United States, Mexico, and Canada. He finds that NAFTA has had a positive overall impact on the three economies, but that there have been some negative consequences as well.

In the United States, Ross finds that NAFTA has led to increased trade and investment between the United States and Mexico, and has created jobs in the United States. However, he also finds that NAFTA has had a negative impact on some American workers, who have lost their jobs as a result of the agreement.

In Mexico, Ross finds that NAFTA has led to increased economic growth and investment, but has also increased income inequality.

In Canada, Ross finds that NAFTA has had a positive impact on the economy, but has also led to some job losses in the manufacturing sector.
