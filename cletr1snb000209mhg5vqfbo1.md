Here are 10 key differences between .NET Core and .NET:

1. Cross-Platform Support: .NET Core was developed to support cross-platform development, meaning it can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. .NET, on the other hand, was primarily developed for Windows and only recently started to offer cross-platform support.
    
2. Open Source: .NET Core is open source and maintained by the .NET Foundation, while .NET is developed and maintained by Microsoft.
    
3. Runtime: .NET Core has its own runtime, while .NET uses the common language runtime (CLR) which is also used in the .NET Framework.
    
4. Size: .NET Core is a smaller, lightweight version of .NET, with a smaller footprint and faster startup times.
    
5. Compatibility: .NET Core is not backward compatible with the .NET Framework, while .NET is backward compatible with the .NET Framework.
    
6. Development Environment: .NET Core uses the cross-platform .NET Core CLI for building and running applications, while .NET uses the Visual Studio development environment.
    
7. Libraries: .NET Core has a smaller set of libraries compared to .NET, but it includes the most commonly used libraries and can be expanded with NuGet packages.
    
8. Performance: .NET Core has better performance compared to .NET, especially when it comes to startup time and memory usage.
    
9. Containerization: .NET Core was designed with containerization in mind, making it easier to deploy and scale applications in a containerized environment.
    
10. Support: .NET Core has a growing community and is actively maintained, but support for .NET may be more readily available through Microsoft's support channels.
    

In summary, .NET Core is a lightweight, open-source, cross-platform version of .NET with its own runtime and development environment, while .NET is a more established development platform with a larger set of libraries and support for the CLR runtime. Choosing between .NET Core and .NET largely depends on your development needs and whether cross-platform support is a requirement.
