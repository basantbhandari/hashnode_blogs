# when to use interface and when to use abstract class

The choice of whether to use an interface or an abstract class depends on the specific needs of your application. Here are some general guidelines that can help you decide when to use an interface and when to use an abstract class:

<mark>Use an interface when:</mark>

1. You want to define a contract that multiple unrelated classes can implement.
    
2. You want to create a loosely-coupled system, where different implementations of an interface can be swapped out easily.
    
3. You want to define behavior that does not depend on state or implementation details.
    
4. You want to define behavior that is applicable to many classes that have no common ancestor.
    

<mark>Use an abstract class when:</mark>

1. You want to provide a default implementation for some methods that derived classes can override.
    
2. You want to define behavior that depends on state or implementation details.
    
3. You want to define a common behavior among a group of related classes.
    
4. You want to define a base class for a hierarchy of classes.
    

In general, if you need to define behavior that is applicable to many classes but does not depend on the state, use an interface. If you need to define behavior that is applicable to a specific hierarchy of related classes and can provide some implementation details, use an abstract class.
