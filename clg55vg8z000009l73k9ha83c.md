In Angular, the constructor and ngOnInit() are two different methods that are used for different purposes.

The constructor is a standard JavaScript/TypeScript method that is called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's properties and to perform any setup that is required for the object to function properly. In Angular, the constructor is used to inject dependencies into a component or a service. Dependencies are other services or objects that a component or service needs to function properly. The constructor is called only once when the component is created.

On the other hand, ngOnInit() is a lifecycle hook method provided by Angular. It is called after the constructor when the component is initialized and the data-bound properties have been initialized. ngOnInit() is called only once, after the first ngOnChanges().

The main difference between the constructor and ngOnInit() is that the constructor is used for dependency injection and initialization of component properties, while ngOnInit() is used for initialization of the component after its data-bound properties have been initialized.

Here is an example of how the constructor and ngOnInit() methods are used in a component:

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
  `
})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnInit {
  title: string;
  message: string;

  constructor() {
    // Inject dependencies and initialize properties
    this.title = 'Example Component';
  }

  ngOnInit() {
    // Initialize component after data-bound properties have been set
    this.message = 'Hello, world!';
  }
}
```

In this example, the constructor is used to inject dependencies and initialize the `title` property of the component. The ngOnInit() method is used to initialize the `message` property of the component after its data-bound properties have been set.
