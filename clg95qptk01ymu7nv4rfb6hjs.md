Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) was the 16th president of the United States, serving from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. Lincoln led the nation through its greatest crisis, the American Civil War, preserving the Union and freeing the slaves. He is considered one of the greatest presidents in American history.

Early Life

Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. His family was poor and Lincoln received only a few years of formal schooling. He was mostly self-educated and became a lawyer in Illinois.

Lincoln was elected to the Illinois state legislature in 1834 and served four terms. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846 and served one term. He did not run for reelection.

American Civil War

In 1860, Lincoln was nominated for president by the new Republican Party. He ran against three other candidates, and won the election with only 40 percent of the vote.

Lincoln was inaugurated on March 4, 1861. On April 12, Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina, and the Civil War began.

Over the next four years, Lincoln led the Union army to victory, preserving the United States as one country. He also issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed all slaves in the Confederacy.

In 1864, Lincoln was reelected president, again winning with only 40 percent of the vote.

Assassination

On April 14, 1865, Lincoln was attending a play at Ford’s Theatre in Washington, D.C., when he was shot in the head by John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer. Lincoln died the next day.

Booth was later killed by Union soldiers. Eight other conspirators were tried and convicted for their roles in the assassination plot.

Lincoln’s Legacy

Lincoln is widely considered one of the greatest presidents in American history. He led the nation through its greatest crisis, the Civil War, and preserved the Union. He also issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed all slaves in the Confederacy.

Lincoln’s assassination made him a martyr, and he is often remembered for his famous speeches, including the Gettysburg Address.
