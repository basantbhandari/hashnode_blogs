# The Difference Between Inc. & Ltd. & Co.

Incorporated (Inc.), Limited (Ltd.), and Company (Co.) are all legal business entities that differ in their ownership structure and liability protection. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. Incorporated (Inc.): This refers to a business entity that has been incorporated and is a separate legal entity from its owners. It means that the company has gone through the process of registering with the state or federal government, and has met the necessary requirements to become a corporation. As a result, the corporation's shareholders are not personally responsible for the company's debts or liabilities. Instead, the corporation itself is responsible for its obligations.
    
2. Limited (Ltd.): This refers to a business entity that has limited liability, meaning that the owners are only liable for the company's debts up to the amount of their investment in the company. In other words, the shareholders of a limited company are not personally responsible for the company's debts and obligations beyond their initial investment. Limited companies are commonly used in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries.
    
3. Company (Co.): This is a more general term that refers to any business entity, whether it is a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or limited liability company. In many countries, the term "company" is often used interchangeably with "corporation."
    

In summary, while all of these terms refer to legal business entities, they differ in terms of their ownership structure and liability protection. Incorporated (Inc.) and Limited (Ltd.) specifically denotes a corporation or a limited company, respectively, while Company (Co.) is a more general term that can refer to any business entity.
