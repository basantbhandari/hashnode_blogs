# different types of inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting some or all of its properties and methods. There are four main types of inheritance:

1. Single inheritance: In single inheritance, a new class is created based on an existing class, which becomes the parent or base class of the new class. The new class inherits all the properties and methods of the base class and can add its own properties and methods.
    
2. Multiple inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a new class is created based on two or more existing classes, which become the parent or base classes of the new class. The new class inherits all the properties and methods of the base classes and can add its own properties and methods.
    
3. Hierarchical inheritance: In hierarchical inheritance, a new class is created based on an existing class, which becomes the parent or base class of the new class. The new class inherits all the properties and methods of the base class and can add its own properties and methods. Other new classes can also be created based on the same base class, resulting in a hierarchical structure.
    
4. Multilevel inheritance: In multilevel inheritance, a new class is created based on an existing class, which becomes the parent or base class of the new class. The new class can then become the parent or base class for another new class, and so on, resulting in a multilevel structure.
    

Note that some programming languages do not support all types of inheritance, and some may have additional types not listed here.
