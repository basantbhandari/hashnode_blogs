# MVC and its life cycle in Dotnet

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern that is widely used in software development, including in the Microsoft .NET Framework. In the context of [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET), the MVC pattern is used to build web applications using a structured approach that separates concerns into three main components: the model, view, and controller.

Here is a brief overview of the MVC life cycle in .NET:

1. Routing: When a request is made to an MVC application, the [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) routing engine maps the URL to a particular controller action method based on the route configuration. The routing engine uses the incoming URL to determine the controller, action method, and any additional parameters that are required to handle the request.
    
2. Controller instantiation: Once the routing engine has determined the appropriate controller and action method to handle the request, the [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC framework creates an instance of the controller and passes any necessary parameters to its constructor.
    
3. Action method execution: The action method is then executed, which may involve accessing data from a database, calling a web service, or performing other operations to generate the necessary output.
    
4. Model binding: During the execution of the action method, the [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC framework uses model binding to map any incoming data from the request to the parameters of the action method. This can include form data, query string parameters, or route data.
    
5. View rendering: Once the action method has finished executing, the [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC framework renders the appropriate view to generate the final output. The view can be a Razor view or a custom view engine, and it typically contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that is used to render the final HTML output.
    
6. Response generation: Finally, the [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC framework generates the HTTP response that is sent back to the client browser, which typically includes the HTML output generated by the view.
    

Throughout this process, various events can be raised that allows developers to customize and extend the behavior of the MVC framework. For example, developers can use action filters to apply custom logic before or after an action method is executed, or they can use global filters to apply logic to all action methods in an application. Additionally, developers can use view engines to customize the way that views are rendered, or they can use partial views to break up complex views into smaller, more manageable components.
