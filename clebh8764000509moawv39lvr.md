# 20 python best coding practices

Here are 20 best coding practices for Python:

1. Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
    
2. Use meaningful and consistent indentation for code blocks.
    
3. Follow the PEP 8 style guide for code formatting and layout.
    
4. Use comments to explain code functionality and purpose, especially for complex or hard-to-understand sections.
    
5. Break code into small, reusable functions with a single, clear responsibility.
    
6. Use exception handling to gracefully handle errors and prevent crashes.
    
7. Use type annotations and docstrings to make code more readable and understandable.
    
8. Avoid long lines of code, and break them up into multiple lines for readability.
    
9. Use whitespace and blank lines to group related code sections and improve readability.
    
10. Use assertions to verify code correctness during testing and development.
    
11. Use object-oriented programming principles to create reusable, modular code.
    
12. Use built-in functions and modules whenever possible to improve performance and reliability.
    
13. Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with system packages.
    
14. Write unit tests to verify code functionality and prevent regressions.
    
15. Use version control to manage code changes and collaborate with others.
    
16. Avoid using global variables, as they can cause unexpected behavior and make code harder to reason about.
    
17. Use meaningful, consistent names for constants and variables that won't change during program execution.
    
18. Use list comprehensions and generator expressions to write concise, readable code.
    
19. Avoid using "magic numbers" in code, and use named constants or variables instead.
    
20. Refactor code to remove duplication and improve readability, even if it is working correctly.
