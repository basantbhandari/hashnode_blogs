He’s called it a “dilemma” and a “tension.” He’s said it’s a “trade-off.”

Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney is grappling with the question of whether to raise interest rates to keep inflation in check, or keep them low to support the country’s economic recovery.

In his first public appearance since the central bank’s rate announcement two weeks ago, Mr. Carney said on Thursday that the decision wasn’t an easy one.

“You’re always balancing,” he said at an event in Toronto. “You’re always looking at the risks.”

The bank’s decision to leave its benchmark overnight rate at 1 per cent for the fourth consecutive time surprised many economists, who had expected a 25-basis-point hike.

In its statement, the bank said it still expects to begin raising rates in the “near term,” but it acknowledged that the recovery isn’t as strong as it had hoped.

Mr. Carney said the bank is still trying to gauge the strength of the recovery and the effect of its previous rate hikes.

“We need to be a bit more certain about how the economy is going to evolve before we take the next step on interest rates,” he said.

The bank’s decision was a victory for those who had argued that the recovery is still too fragile to begin raising rates.

David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff + Associates, said the bank made the right decision.

“The economy is not strong enough to warrant a rate hike,” he said.

But Mr. Rosenberg said the bank’s decision to leave the door open to a rate hike in the near future is a mistake.

“They’re just confusing the market,” he said. “They’re sending out mixed signals.”
