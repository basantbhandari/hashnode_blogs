# what is the purpose of params keywords?

In C#, the `params` the keyword is used to declare a method parameter that takes a variable number of arguments of the same type. This allows you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments of the specified type to a method.

The purpose of the `params` the keyword is to provide flexibility and convenience when calling methods that accept variable-length argument lists. Instead of having to create and pass an array of arguments, you can simply pass the individual arguments separated by commas, and the compiler will create an array for you.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of `params` the keyword:

```csharp
csharpCopy codestatic void Main(string[] args)
{
    int sum = AddNumbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    Console.WriteLine($"Sum of numbers is: {sum}"); // Output: Sum of numbers is: 15
}

static int AddNumbers(params int[] numbers)
{
    int sum = 0;
    foreach (int num in numbers)
    {
        sum += num;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

In this example, the `AddNumbers` method takes a `params` parameter named `numbers`, which can accept an arbitrary number of integers. Inside the method, we iterate over the `numbers` array using a `foreach` loop, adding each number to the `sum` variable. Finally, we return the sum of the numbers.

In the `Main` method, we call `AddNumbers` with 5 integer arguments separated by commas. The `params` keyword allows us to pass these arguments directly to the method without having to create an array explicitly.

The `params` the keyword is useful in situations where the number of arguments that a method needs to process may vary at runtime or where it is impractical to create an array explicitly for the arguments. However, it's important to use the `params` keyword judiciously and only when it makes sense to do so, as it can make the code less readable if overused.
