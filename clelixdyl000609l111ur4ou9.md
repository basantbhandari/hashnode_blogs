# Can we force garbage collection to run in Dotnet

Yes, in .NET, you can use the `System.GC` class to request that the garbage collector perform a collection of unused objects. However, it's important to note that forcing a garbage collection to occur is generally not recommended, and should only be done in specific cases where it's necessary to optimize memory usage.

Here's an example of how to force a garbage collection to occur in C#:

```csharp
System.GC.Collect();
```

This call requests that the garbage collector perform a collection of unused objects in the managed heap. However, it's important to note that this call does not guarantee that the garbage collector will actually collect all unused objects, as the garbage collector is designed to optimize its collection strategy based on the state of the application and the available resources.

In general, it's recommended to let the garbage collector manage memory automatically, as it's designed to optimize memory usage and minimize the impact on application performance. However, there may be some scenarios where it's necessary to optimize memory usages, such as in memory-intensive applications or long-running processes, and in those cases, forcing a garbage collection may be appropriate.
