on BlackRock

In his research article, "BlackRock: The World's Biggest Shadow Bank," Larry Fink discusses the role that BlackRock plays in the global financial system. Fink argues that BlackRock is a "shadow bank" because it is not subject to the same regulations as traditional banks. He argues that BlackRock's size and influence make it a major player in the global financial system, and that its activities could have a significant impact on the global economy.
