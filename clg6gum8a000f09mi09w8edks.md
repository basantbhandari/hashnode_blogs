Here are 20 points comparing Angular and jQuery:

Angular:

1. Angular is a full-fledged framework for building web applications, while jQuery is a JavaScript library that provides a set of utility functions for working with the DOM.
    
2. Angular is written in TypeScript, a statically typed language that adds features to JavaScript, while jQuery is written in plain JavaScript.
    
3. Angular provides a component-based architecture, which promotes modularity and code reuse, while jQuery relies on selectors and methods for manipulating the DOM.
    
4. Angular has built-in support for data binding, routing, and dependency injection, while jQuery requires plugins or additional libraries for these features.
    
5. Angular provides a powerful templating engine that supports declarative rendering of HTML, while jQuery requires developers to write HTML and manipulate it using JavaScript.
    
6. Angular supports two-way data binding, which allows changes made to the model to be reflected in the view and vice versa, while jQuery requires developers to manually update the DOM in response to changes in the model.
    
7. Angular provides built-in support for testing, including unit tests and end-to-end tests, while jQuery requires additional tools for testing.
    
8. Angular has a steep learning curve due to its complexity, while jQuery is relatively easy to learn and use.
    
9. Angular provides a set of guidelines and best practices for building scalable and maintainable applications, while jQuery does not.
    
10. Angular applications are typically larger in size and more complex than jQuery applications.
    

jQuery:

1. jQuery is a lightweight library, which makes it faster to load and use than Angular.
    
2. jQuery provides a simplified syntax for working with the DOM, which makes it easier to manipulate elements and handle events.
    
3. jQuery has a large and active community, which means there are many resources and plugins available.
    
4. jQuery can be used with other frameworks and libraries, while Angular is a complete framework that requires a significant investment in learning.
    
5. jQuery provides cross-browser compatibility, while Angular has more dependencies and may require additional libraries to work on all browsers.
    
6. jQuery can be used for simple animations and effects, while Angular requires a more complex approach using directives and animations.
    
7. jQuery has a wide range of plugins for adding additional functionality, while Angular requires more custom code for advanced features.
    
8. jQuery can be used for building smaller, lightweight applications, while Angular is better suited for large, complex applications.
    
9. jQuery provides support for legacy browsers, while Angular is designed for modern browsers.
    
10. jQuery is still widely used for simple web pages and applications, while Angular is often used for large, enterprise-level applications.
