Angular is an open-source, front-end web application framework that is used to build dynamic and interactive web applications. It is developed and maintained by Google and provides a set of tools and features that help developers to build complex web applications with ease.

Angular is built on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, as its main programming language. Some of the key features of Angular include:

1. Data binding: Angular provides two-way data binding, which means that changes made in the model are automatically reflected in the view, and vice versa.
    
2. Dependency injection: Angular uses dependency injection to manage the dependencies of different components in an application. This makes it easy to write modular and testable code.
    
3. Directives: Angular provides a set of directives that can be used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. This allows developers to create custom HTML tags and attributes, and attach behavior to them.
    
4. Templates: Angular uses templates to define the structure of an application's user interface. Templates can include HTML, CSS, and Angular-specific syntax.
    
5. Routing: Angular provides a powerful routing system that can be used to define the navigation paths of an application. This makes it easy to create single-page applications that can navigate between different views without reloading the page.
    

Overall, Angular is a powerful and flexible framework that can be used to build complex web applications with ease. Its rich set of features, strong community support, and excellent documentation make it a popular choice among developers.
