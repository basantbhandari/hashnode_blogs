GraphQL is a query language for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that was developed by Facebook in 2012 and later open-sourced in 2015. It allows clients to specify exactly what data they need from an API, making it more efficient and flexible than traditional REST APIs.

With GraphQL, clients send a query specifying the data they need, and the server responds with only that data. This eliminates the need for multiple API calls to retrieve related data, which can be slow and inefficient. Additionally, GraphQL allows clients to specify the shape of the data they need, which can simplify the process of parsing and working with the response.

GraphQL can be used with any programming language and framework, and is not tied to any specific database or storage engine. It has become increasingly popular in recent years and is used by companies such as GitHub, Shopify, and Airbnb.
