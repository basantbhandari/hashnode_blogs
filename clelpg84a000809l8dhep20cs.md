# ADO.NET vs Entity framework

[ADO.NET](http://ADO.NET) and Entity Framework (EF) are both data access technologies provided by Microsoft, but they have some important differences.

[ADO.NET](http://ADO.NET) is a low-level data access technology that allows developers to work directly with database connections, commands, and data readers. It provides a high degree of control and flexibility but requires developers to write a lot of code to manage data access.

Entity Framework, on the other hand, is a high-level Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that allows developers to work with data in the form of objects and classes, rather than having to work directly with SQL queries and database tables. EF provides a number of features, including mapping between database tables and .NET classes, tracking changes to objects and persisting those changes to the database, querying data using LINQ, managing relationships between objects and database tables, and generating database schema from .NET classes.

One of the main advantages of Entity Framework over [ADO.NET](http://ADO.NET) is its productivity. Because EF handles a lot of the low-level details of data access, developers can focus more on the business logic of their applications. EF also provides a high level of abstraction, which makes it easier to work with complex data models and manage relationships between tables.

However, Entity Framework can also have a performance overhead compared to [ADO.NET](http://ADO.NET), as it adds an extra layer of abstraction between the application code and the database. Additionally, EF can have a steeper learning curve for developers who are not familiar with ORM concepts and patterns.

Overall, the choice between [ADO.NET](http://ADO.NET) and Entity Framework depends on the specific needs of the application and the development team's expertise. While [ADO.NET](http://ADO.NET) may be a better choice for simple applications with straightforward data access needs, Entity Framework is a more powerful and flexible solution for complex data models and applications.
