"It is important to realize that in mathematics, the creation of new concepts is often more important than the solution of problems. To a far greater extent than most people realize, the solution of mathematical problems depends on the existence of suitable concepts."

Edsger W. Dijkstra, research article, "A Discipline of Programming", 1976
