# what are ORM and what different types

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping, which is a technique used in software engineering to map objects to relational databases. ORM is a programming technique that allows developers to work with objects in their code, while the ORM tool handles the translation of these objects to the appropriate SQL queries needed to interact with the database.

ORM tools provide several benefits, including:

1. Reduced development time and code complexity
    
2. Increased code maintainability and flexibility
    
3. Better performance and scalability

There are several ORM tools available for use in .NET applications, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular ORM tools in .NET include:

1. Entity Framework: Entity Framework is a popular ORM tool provided by Microsoft that allows developers to work with data in the form of objects and classes. It supports several different database providers, including Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
    
2. NHibernate: NHibernate is an open-source ORM tool for .NET that is based on the Java Hibernate project. It provides a high level of flexibility and customization but has a steeper learning curve than some other ORM tools.
    
3. Dapper: Dapper is a lightweight ORM tool for .NET that focuses on performance and simplicity. It is designed to be fast and efficient and provides a simple API for executing queries and mapping data to objects.
    
4. LLBLGen Pro: LLBLGen Pro is a commercial ORM tool for .NET that provides a high degree of customization and flexibility. It supports several different database providers and allows developers to generate code for complex data access scenarios.
    
5. LINQ to SQL: LINQ to SQL is a lightweight ORM tool provided by Microsoft that allows developers to work with data in a SQL Server database using LINQ queries. It provides a simple API for executing queries and mapping data to objects.
    

Each of these ORM tools has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of ORM tool depends on the specific needs of the application and the development team's expertise.
