feature:

1) open source under MIT license

2) you need to list all the questions you have in the question.txt file and put the path of the question file in the config.py file

3) other configurations as described by comments in the config.py file need to update according to your use

4) when we run the main.py file through Python, it automatically asks those questions to chatGPT and publishes the answer to the hash node article

5) it uses specy, open ai, graphql, hash node, request

6) make your blogging journey fast and automated

7) you can contribute to the project and can add as many features as you like to support blogging automation
